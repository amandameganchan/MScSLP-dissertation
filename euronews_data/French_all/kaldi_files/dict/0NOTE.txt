notes:
- files originally from GlobalPhone corpus
- files marked as _backup are the original copies of the files before I edited them
- sed_command.sh aligns the phone set with the GlobalPhone Spanish/German/Polish lexicon conventions by swapping some non-silence phones for new notation [full alignment + notes are in the first appendix of the dissertation]
