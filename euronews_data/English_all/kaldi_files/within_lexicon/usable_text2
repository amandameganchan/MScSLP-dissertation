20130101_20130531_en_aaby-0016 can you give us some articles of the constitution which are at the centre of the conflict between the opposition and the presidency
20130101_20130531_en_aaby-0017 this constitution has given the opportunity for basic rights to be abused
20130101_20130531_en_aaby-0018 especially freedom of speech opinion and creativity
20130101_20130531_en_aaby-0019 by stipulating the freedoms that should be practised under what calls the basic rules of the state and society
20130101_20130531_en_aaby-0020 this raises a question for those who misinterpret islamic
20130101_20130531_en_aaby-0021 and use it crush freedom
20130101_20130531_en_aaby-0022 now the same people are the majority and they abuse islam and sharia
20130101_20130531_en_aaby-0023 they see this as a restrictive tool unlike us
20130101_20130531_en_aaby-0024 these people are now using the islamic law as a tool to threaten liberties
20130101_20130531_en_aaby-0025 to discriminate and spread hate
20130101_20130531_en_aaby-0026 they are at the centre of political life
20130101_20130531_en_aaby-0027 they can use these articles of the constitution in a negative way that could offend islam

20130101_20130531_en_aaby-0035 that is why they are reluctant to

20130101_20130531_en_aadn-0011 for example the united states voted against the palestinian authority obtaining observer status at the un whereas eu heavyweights such as france spain and italy all voted in favour the rest abstained and only one country voted against the czech republic
20130101_20130531_en_aadn-0012 so you have a european union which is
20130101_20130531_en_aadn-0013 over the palestinian question which nonetheless gives the palestinians more support than the united states does
20130101_20130531_en_aadn-0014 so israel which is the other main actor is wary of
20130101_20130531_en_aadn-0015 and prefers to work on a middle east roadmap with the united states as a partner

20130101_20130531_en_aafn-0071 very important is that regulatory authorities work very closely together the academic and communities and also with that provide kinds of services

20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0015 and has a very positive experience for
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0016 the european union has contributed enormously
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0017 to the economic growth of the country contributed to the modernisation of our laws
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0019 spain
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0020 i would like to know which plans has to solve the flag crisis northern ireland and how you expect to manage the rise of nationalism
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0021 europe so maria would like to know what you think about nationalism you must be a bit concerned by recent events in belfast
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0022 yes indeed we are and i think what it shows is the need for constant vigilance to work on our
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0023 we had a conflict in northern ireland which lasted for about thirty years was a very violent conflict three
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0024 people
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0025 lost their lives big number of people
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0026 to have been killed and many many more injured
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0027 over
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0028 we worked on peace process the irish and the british government together with the political parties in northern ireland which brought about a settlement and the establishment of a shared administration in northern ireland we have however seen in recent weeks
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0029 which are worrying i hope that they not last but i think it shows the challenges that we have to build a shared future for people in northern ireland i think it also shows the degree to which national identity and other identities are very strong throughout europe the european union has been successful
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0030 in building a union of five hundred million people
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0031 within that union are many peoples and many groups of people who
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0032 have very strong national or regional identity and i think important that we first of all respect those identities but that is mutual respect all round
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0033 that we work together as a people in europe to build a better future for all our citizens
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0036 do you intend to anything to curtail power or is that killing the goose which
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0037 lays all the eggs
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0039 when croatia becomes a
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0040 be twenty-eight
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0041 member states
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0042 i think important that we do our work in europe using the
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0043 method that there is a strong sense
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0044 of all of the member states working together of there being mutual respect between smaller states large states
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0046 does make the whole situation a little unbalanced
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0047 i think in order to appreciate economic power we have to
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0048 how interdependent we all are on each other
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0049 i think that is the whole rationale for the european union that no individual state
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0050 no individual country
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0051 to be a great power on its
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0052 the power that we all have the economic strength that we all have
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0053 comes from our interdependence big strength that the european union has is that there are five hundred million people in the european union is the biggest consumer
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0054 in the world

20130101_20130531_en_aajo-0002 the people were told he was having his cancer seen to in havana
20130101_20130531_en_aajo-0006 he promised supporters in july that he was totally free of cancer
20130101_20130531_en_aajo-0007 he went back on this on
20130101_20130531_en_aajo-0009 my firm opinion full like a full moon irrevocable absolute total
20130101_20130531_en_aajo-0010 that should it become constitutionally required to convene new presidential elections
20130101_20130531_en_aajo-0011 should
20130101_20130531_en_aajo-0013 while legal protocol was debated by chavez supporters and opponents
20130101_20130531_en_aajo-0014 his devoted prayed for him
20130101_20130531_en_aajo-0015 protege
20130101_20130531_en_aajo-0016 whom he had named to succeed him by january began to inform public that his patron would return only when the doctors decreed he could
20130101_20130531_en_aajo-0017 though he might the inauguration date
20130101_20130531_en_aajo-0018 said that even if chavez were absent from the national assembly
20130101_20130531_en_aajo-0019 he could still be sworn office by the supreme court
20130101_20130531_en_aajo-0022 opposition raised fears of a power vacuum
20130101_20130531_en_aajo-0024 and it did not set a new date
20130101_20130531_en_aajo-0025 we asked journalist marta aguirre of daily
20130101_20130531_en_aajo-0026 espana
20130101_20130531_en_aajo-0027 in caracas how the court verdict been received by venezuelans
20130101_20130531_en_aajo-0029 but this was obviously going to happen
20130101_20130531_en_aajo-0030 because every time the government decides in a way that
20130101_20130531_en_aajo-0031 the constitution
20130101_20130531_en_aajo-0032 it to its own
20130101_20130531_en_aajo-0033 the government holds all the
20130101_20130531_en_aajo-0034 and so it a surprise
20130101_20130531_en_aajo-0035 the venezuelans are sufficiently
20130101_20130531_en_aajo-0037 the country does not the clear medical diagnosis of president chavez the prognosis an lot has been kept isolated about this and the latest information is really blurred
20130101_20130531_en_aajo-0039 in
20130101_20130531_en_aajo-0040 long could this power vacuum go on with chavez absent
20130101_20130531_en_aajo-0041 long are people prepared to wait
20130101_20130531_en_aajo-0042 the government is stalling time
20130101_20130531_en_aajo-0043 in case there are elections so they can be sure of winning them even without
20130101_20130531_en_aajo-0045 that the
20130101_20130531_en_aajo-0046 the majority who voted for him and not for party or his disciples they vote for chavez for the messianic and charismatic figure president chavez
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0001 premeditation behind the killing of three kurdish activists in paris caused many to ponder on the motives behind the murders
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0002 one thing is certain the deaths and the manner of the killings a single bullet to the head of two of the women a third was hit in the chest and head suggests something more than a botched burglary
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0003 journalist andrea simone explores the murders in more detail
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0004 our correspondent in paris giovanni is at the scene of the killings as security forces begin their complex and no doubt international investigation into the triple murder
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0005 we saw a crowd of distraught kurds protesting against the killings you have spoken to them what are their feelings about the deaths
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0006 shock and
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0007 we in the centre of paris where a large kurdish community lives since morning when the news broke hundreds made their way here
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0008 most of them are in shock
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0009 one expected such a cold blooded crime
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0010 the fact that this violence was carried out against women three women activists it emphasises the shock and level of violence involved
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0011 for the hundreds here there been moments of reflection an unreal silence
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0012 at other times slogans were shouted
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0013 anti turkish chants but also against others
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0014 so there been moments of
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0015 and moments of rage which the people could not contain
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0016 there already a number of being put forward the murders with ramifications beyond french borders where will french investigators begin the probe
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0017 in
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0018 firstly we have to be careful as the investigation has started
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0019 we must be aware that just hours earlier peace talks between the turkish
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0021 so the police will be looking into those who want to derail any peace process
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0022 it be factions based in
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0023 that want sabotage the talks
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0025 we
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0027 syrian involvement is also being mentioned
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0028 we do know that
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0029 is an important city for the
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0030 in terms of its capacity to raise funds
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0034 the
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0035 she worked alongside abdullah
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0036 and his brother
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0037 we know she held some top positions in the organisation
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0038 we know she has been in northern iraq
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0039 she then came to europe where she has in several countries including germany
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0040 lately been involved in getting the kurdish message
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0041 the death of such a high profile victim suggests a political motive behind
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0042 the
20130101_20130531_en_aajq-0002 turned to a specialist on turkey at the french
20130101_20130531_en_aajq-0003 and
20130101_20130531_en_aajq-0004 what are the consequences now for the peace process
20130101_20130531_en_aajq-0006 process through to the end
20130101_20130531_en_aajq-0008 for fundraising
20130101_20130531_en_aajq-0009 as far as paris is concerned is true that for a number of years there have been many cases of revolutionary taxes
20130101_20130531_en_aajq-0010 leaders call them
20130101_20130531_en_aajq-0011 personally i would call it a racket towards turkish or kurdish shop owners who in paris
20130101_20130531_en_aajr-0001 the visit of president hamid karzai for talks in washington with obama marks the beginning of the end of negotiations between the two countries on the
20130101_20130531_en_aajr-0002 of withdrawal and the future stability of afghanistan
20130101_20130531_en_aajr-0003 after ten years of war the onus is on everyone to get it right
20130101_20130531_en_aajr-0004 the
20130101_20130531_en_aajr-0005 three fundamental talking points are how many american troops will remain in afghanistan after bulk of the military withdraw immunity from prosecution for us military serving in afghanistan and peace talks between kabul and moderate taliban clans
20130101_20130531_en_aajr-0006 so how many troops will remain in theatre after american mandate ends in fourteen the debate is still raging in the corridors of power the top us commander in the region marine corps general john allen has a force of between six and fifteen
20130101_20130531_en_aajr-0007 according to sources the defense department has drawn up a plan which will leave between three
20130101_20130531_en_aajr-0008 and nine
20130101_20130531_en_aajr-0009 on the ground
20130101_20130531_en_aajr-0010 a of contention is immunity from prosecution for us military
20130101_20130531_en_aajr-0011 serving in the country this was a major disagreement between washington and baghdad when the pulled out of
20130101_20130531_en_aajr-0012 two thousand one
20130101_20130531_en_aajr-0013 those in the know karzai have some room for manoeuvre on this but it depends on what
20130101_20130531_en_aajr-0014 washington make
20130101_20130531_en_aajr-0015 last but not least some form of taliban involvement in the political process is key to prevent the country from slipping back into violence as soon as us troops pack
20130101_20130531_en_aajr-0016 informal meetings have already taken place on this issue last month in chantilly france members of the high council for peace in afghanistan the taliban and others took part in a seminar on the future of afghanistan
20130101_20130531_en_aajr-0017 both leaders want and need a win win outcome karzai wants to look less like a us puppet back home and obama needs a smooth withdrawal to justify his decision to pull out of the country
20130101_20130531_en_aajs-0001 france
20130101_20130531_en_aajs-0004 talks with jailed leader abdullah
20130101_20130531_en_aajs-0005 with a view to ending the conflict
20130101_20130531_en_aajs-0006 and
20130101_20130531_en_aajs-0007 residents and people working nearby are shocked this barbaric savage crime is unspeakable
20130101_20130531_en_aajs-0008 we shattered i think someone wanted above all to attack symbols
20130101_20130531_en_aajs-0010 in france and never attacked in such a ferocious way such a busy street there are lots of questions to answer

20130101_20130531_en_aakz-0004 of the
20130101_20130531_en_aakz-0006 the recent tragedies have taken the dakar death toll to sixty-six since the first edition in seventy-nine
20130101_20130531_en_aala-0001 i would like to know whether the european union has the power to intervene militarily in the current crisis in mali
20130101_20130531_en_aala-0002 i we have to be very careful for reasons
20130101_20130531_en_aala-0003 of all in the current international context libya and especially syria have played a very important role in this
20130101_20130531_en_aala-0004 foreign intervention is not very popular
20130101_20130531_en_aala-0005 it is no longer considered an efficient credible or legitimate means of political regulation
20130101_20130531_en_aala-0007 it is up to africans to decide how to restore peace and law in an african country
20130101_20130531_en_aala-0008 so i think we can count on europe and generally africans behaving very discreetly in this intervention
20130101_20130531_en_aala-0009 having said this it fair to ask how african weapons alone
20130101_20130531_en_aala-0010 can resolve such a complex case
20130101_20130531_en_aala-0011 it is possible that in the best of cases once the forces that have taken over northern mali
20130101_20130531_en_aala-0012 have left the cities once peace has returned to most of northern mali
20130101_20130531_en_aala-0013 then non african troops could intervene to finish off the work
20130101_20130531_en_aala-0014 to get the going again
20130101_20130531_en_aala-0015 that is a possibility
20130101_20130531_en_aala-0016 that would require discussions within europe and not sure that in the current context there would be a true will to take part in such an intervention
20130101_20130531_en_aala-0017 germany
20130101_20130531_en_aala-0018 we know plays a pivotal role when it comes to taking decisions at a european level
20130101_20130531_en_aala-0019 held a non interventionist stance ever since reunification
20130101_20130531_en_aala-0021 considering that the situation in mali is less straightforward than the libyan
20130101_20130531_en_aala-0022 at least from the start we can expect the eu to be very prudent not to say openly against the of any intervention

20130101_20130531_en_aaqg-0036 a forced silence from the media
20130101_20130531_en_aaqg-0037 is almost impossible to see pictures of it why
20130101_20130531_en_aaqg-0038 say that the official strategy is not to give pictures to the
20130101_20130531_en_aaqg-0039 these islamists these jihadists who are occupying north mali are using some of the civil population as shields and so i think the goal is to avoid scaring the mali population worrying them
20130101_20130531_en_aaqg-0040 and also to show that someone is here to help them but again avoid showing them images of collateral damage
20130101_20130531_en_aaqg-0041 french strategy then and what could be the african force strategy how long will this war last
20130101_20130531_en_aaqg-0043 the islamists who are occupying the north of mali and also the west
20130101_20130531_en_aaqg-0044 the very well this their advantage the fact they are from the region and have been living there for many years
20130101_20130531_en_aaqg-0045 know the smallest rock the smallest cavern in that region
20130101_20130531_en_aaqg-0046 among different threats there is one of probable islamist retaliation on various countries like nigeria algeria niger even senegal for example
20130101_20130531_en_aaqg-0047 absolutely and can tell you
20130101_20130531_en_aaqg-0048 services the
20130101_20130531_en_aaqg-0049 the security forces
20130101_20130531_en_aaqg-0050 are on maximum alert
20130101_20130531_en_aaqg-0051 but senegal is not the only country which is exposed right now niger is a neighbour of mali there is algeria
20130101_20130531_en_aaqg-0052 i think it is country which knows jihadists best especially
20130101_20130531_en_aaqg-0053 but the most countries in the region are senegal niger maybe guinea and then ivory coast
20130101_20130531_en_aaqg-0054 on thursday in paris there will be a

20130101_20130531_en_aaqg-0056 the
20130101_20130531_en_aaqg-0057 important proves that we are in a post war reflection
20130101_20130531_en_aaqg-0058 this is a pretty good signal because as the french defence said you do war to destroy an enemy
20130101_20130531_en_aaqg-0059 you have to think of the civil population and their return after the war
20130101_20130531_en_aaqg-0060 put the structures back into operation
20130101_20130531_en_aaqg-0061 for months these jihadists have been cutting off molesting women for adultery banning people from smoking or going to the movies or playing football
20130101_20130531_en_aaqg-0062 this is unacceptable
20130101_20130531_en_aaqg-0063 the north of mali has to get its serenity back
20130101_20130531_en_aaqg-0064 it is a country where people life where people love to have fun

20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0004 before
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0005 results for twelve lets talk about series of the incidents involving the seven
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0006 which is made by rival boeing that be seen as a good thing for airbus but is it really
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0008 again very very soon
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0009 a
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0010 you understand that the aviation industry is organised in a way that we agencies that verify the safety of our aircraft
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0011 and why we are one of the safest forms of
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0012 in the world be it boeing or airbus
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0013 despite your good results for twelve boeing was well ahead of airbus in terms of orders and
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0014 your
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0015 rival knocked you off the number one spot after several years what lessons can airbus learn from that
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0016 the lesson is that in twelve we had a very good year which was better than expected with deliveries up ten percent
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0017 we delivered five hundred eighty-eight aircraft
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0018 so you say we fell a long way behind boeing we remain the market leader both in terms of the backlog of orders
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0019 with orders for close to
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0021 to our customers
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0023 financial state
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0025 especially if you look at
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0028 after you first came up the concept of the a three eighty you have only two hundred fifty-seven firm orders when do you expect to finally get over the problem of cracks appearing in the a three wings and for sales really off
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0029 firstly the problem of the micro found on aircraft in service in early twelve has been fixed
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0030 we found the cause we have come up with solutions and so hundred planes currently in service with airlines are being gradually retrofitted through to the end of fourteen
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0031 which is consistent with what we told our customers
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0032 problem is completely behind us
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0033 true that present market sales of larger aircraft are a little soft
20130101_20130531_en_aars-0003 net orders forty-nine percent
20130101_20130531_en_aars-0005 was grounded by european and us
20130101_20130531_en_aars-0006 because of a potential fire risk from batteries it is not yet clear how much of a set back that will be for boeing but analyst it could cost the
20130101_20130531_en_aars-0007 dear boeing is going to forge ahead
20130101_20130531_en_aars-0008 regardless they have to
20130101_20130531_en_aars-0011 the a three
20130101_20130531_en_aars-0012 a it remains confident the a three will achieve its maiden flight by the middle of year
20130101_20130531_en_aart-0002 resulting in faster safer and less
20130101_20130531_en_aart-0003 surgery
20130101_20130531_en_aart-0004 when we use
20130101_20130531_en_aart-0005 glue there will be no
20130101_20130531_en_aart-0006 for general anaesthesia
20130101_20130531_en_aart-0007 instead will use local anaesthesia
20130101_20130531_en_aart-0008 this means that the operation will be shorter
20130101_20130531_en_aart-0009 fewer complications
20130101_20130531_en_aart-0010 for people
20130101_20130531_en_aart-0011 the research team say many elderly patients struggle with general anaesthesia
20130101_20130531_en_aart-0012 scientists are convinced the glue will eradicate the problem
20130101_20130531_en_aart-0013 after the fractured bone has healed the glue will degrade and be absorbed by the body leaving no traces behind
20130101_20130531_en_aart-0014 at the moment an adult that receives this sort of treatment has to be away from work for about three months and in hospital for about week
20130101_20130531_en_aart-0015 with the new
20130101_20130531_en_aart-0016 we expect patients to leave hospital the same evening or the next day and go back to work after two or three days
20130101_20130531_en_aart-0017 but there are still questions of safety to address and scientists are
20130101_20130531_en_aart-0018 toxicology reports to ensure the substance is not harmful if the glue passes the test researchers will begin animal trials confident operations using the glue could begin some time this year

20130101_20130531_en_aarv-0003 it is a very dangerous a very uncertain a very fluid situation and i think we have to prepare for the possibility of bad news ahead

20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0018 this is also reason why
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0019 i welcome
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0020 the swift action taken by france
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0022 clear assessment that it was needed
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0023 to take action to pave the way
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0024 for and african led
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0025 obviously france is a member of nato is considering helping this operation
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0026 planes or drones or intelligence all sharing resources
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0028 are assisting
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0029 with logistics
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0030 capacity
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0031 surveillance reconnaissance but they must be coordinating their efforts through brussels through here so somehow nato is
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0032 involved in this sense as a hub
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0033 nato as an organisation is not involved the european union is training
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0034 soldiers
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0036 european union doing
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0037 there is a strong need for training and
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0038 education
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0039 of
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0040 so i welcome
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0041 this
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0042 eu
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0044 mali to become a breeding ground for
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0045 nato has dealt with
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0048 travelling from country to country
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0049 all problems
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0051 that the united nation security council has mandated an african led stabilisation force to take action
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0053 a weapon
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0054 for this kind of
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0055 threat
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0057 we seen security incidents
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0058 along the syrian turkish we have seen
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0059 across the border loss of life on the turkish side of the border
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0060 we have seen the launch of missiles
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0061 on syrian
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0062 but close to
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0063 the turkish border so there is a real potential threat
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0064 an this a why
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0065 decided to demonstrate a clear solidarity with turkey
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0066 augment
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0068 of turkish population and turkish territory
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0069 could be used for other maybe offensive actions like patrolling
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0070 are there any plans to use them or any other in further military action if the situation in and around escalates
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0071 we have no intention to intervene militarily in syria and we clear right from outset
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0072 that the
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0073 of the patriot missiles is
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0074 defensive measure we have no intention
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0075 to use it to prepare a no fly zone actually technically not designed
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0076 to
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0077 prepare or enforce no fly
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0078 however it changes the strategic balance
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0079 is it a further pressure on the regime and an encouragement
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0080 the rebels deployment of these weapons
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0081 the purpose of this deployment is effective and protection of the population and turkish
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0082 but having said
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0083 of course it also acts as a clear deterrence so that the regime in damascus
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0085 turkey
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0086 and i really urge regime in damascus to
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0088 we mentioned afghanistan your operation there is
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0089 stage after two thousand fourteen
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0091 we have decided that we will stay afghanistan also beyond two thousand fourteen we follow our plan our plan is to gradually hand over the responsibility for security to the afghans
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0092 process has been started and be completed by end of two thousand fourteen so
20130101_20130531_en_aasu-0093 the end of two thousand fourteen our current

20130101_20130531_en_aaua-0018 sometimes it helps to play a little golf together
20130101_20130531_en_aaua-0020 make the
20130101_20130531_en_aaua-0021 any easier
20130101_20130531_en_aaua-0022 and
20130101_20130531_en_aaua-0025 folks are coming and
20130101_20130531_en_aaua-0026 taking pictures with their
20130101_20130531_en_aaua-0027 promise
20130101_20130531_en_aaua-0028 nice to
20130101_20130531_en_aaua-0029 and we have a wonderful time
20130101_20130531_en_aaua-0031 and
20130101_20130531_en_aaua-0032 you
20130101_20130531_en_aaua-0033 big spending socialist
20130101_20130531_en_aaua-0034 obama says going to have more for socialising
20130101_20130531_en_aaua-0035 his growing daughters are more independent now
20130101_20130531_en_aaua-0036 still has a whole stack of commitments
20130101_20130531_en_aaua-0037 the center for american progress action fund
20130101_20130531_en_aaua-0039 i think the two issues that he most wants on the agenda are guns and immigration he wants to fix that
20130101_20130531_en_aaua-0041 is the house of representatives unfortunately is engaged in some very dangerous tactics threatening make
20130101_20130531_en_aaua-0042 default on its debt threatening to shut down our government unless obama agrees to very steep cuts in benefits to seniors and poor people and other groups that really need those
20130101_20130531_en_aaua-0043 so unfortunately i think
20130101_20130531_en_aaua-0044 have to play with their game of brinksmanship and hopefully find a way
20130101_20130531_en_aaua-0045 americans cherish their constitution will this
20130101_20130531_en_aaua-0046 or hinder obama in addressing the controversy over firearms
20130101_20130531_en_aaua-0047 i think the second amendment of the
20130101_20130531_en_aaua-0048 constitution provides some protections for firearms and was recently interpreted by our supreme court as providing an individual
20130101_20130531_en_aaua-0049 right to own a firearm but i think that the of the second amendment actually exceeds the reality of the second amendment
20130101_20130531_en_aaua-0050 at that supreme court decision
20130101_20130531_en_aaua-0051 mentioned which was written by one of the most conservative justices on the
20130101_20130531_en_aaua-0052 even justice

20130101_20130531_en_aaua-0068 i think still some of that
20130101_20130531_en_aaua-0069 a people who cast a vote for obama i think were motivated as much by fear of the that romney was putting forth as they were by enthusiasm
20130101_20130531_en_aaua-0072 the same sort of numbers turn out in washington when

20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0005 barack
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0006 picked two former senate colleagues of his
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0007 to run the state and defense departments john kerry and chuck
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0008 both men draw heavily on vietnam war experience
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0010 convey in some fashion the importance of the lessons
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0011 to be drawn from vietnam
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0013 and that sense both of them distinguish themselves
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0014 and both probably are wise enough to draw some wider lessons from it
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0015 we have
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0016 like an obama doctrine yet
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0017 we an obama doctrine
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0018 i have often said
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0019 and at
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0020 political risk to myself
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0022 i think these two guys can provide the strategy for the doctrine and what should that strategy be
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0023 i think it should first of all take as its point of departure recognition of fact
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0024 that traditional
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0025 global conflicts that we witnessed over the last two hundred years
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0026 are no longer going to waged in the future that is say the notion of global
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0027 by a single power
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0028 is no longer feasible
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0029 even for the most
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0030 but at the same time we faced with many more simultaneous conflicts
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0031 with some potentially high risks
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0032 and therefore our response has to be far more intelligent diversified
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0033 hopefully
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0034 with other major
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0035 states
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0036 and avoid
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0037 kind
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0038 total confrontation
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0039 that was implicit in our recent historic
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0041 because has a lot of foreign policy capital
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0043 how should obama spend this capital what should be his priorities
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0044 the priorities are to some extent
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0045 what we already confront
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0046 which is increasing conflict and tension in the middle east
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0047 on a
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0048 of fronts in the middle east
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0049 not just the traditional one which is the israeli palestinian one
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0050 but the syrian
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0051 and its potential
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0052 for wider regional tensions
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0053 he has to confront
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0054 the risks posed by iran
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0055 but then beyond if look at the map of the world and if you look
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0056 of the southern boundaries of eurasia
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0057 starting with
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0058 north korea
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0059 through the china sea
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0060 india and china

20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0064 then all the way to suez and egypt and then all the way to
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0065 and
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0066 we are confronting a real belt of potentially explosive circumstances
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0067 talk about
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0068 there are some observers
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0069 who believe that under obama america has turned european
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0070 i should take this as a compliment
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0071 but
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0072 it is
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0073 poignant sarcasm here
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0074 we know that
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0075 europe lot of
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0076 that
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0077 there was a lot that went wrong in europe but we also that
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0078 europe
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0079 demonstrated a sense of responsibility and showed political leadership
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0080 and to this
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0081 is there anything that america can learn from europe these
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0082 well in a way yes it looks at europe and some of its problems
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0083 almost like a mirror image of some of our problems
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0084 serious fiscal problems
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0085 economic conflicts
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0086 some serious polarisation internally
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0087 gridlock politically
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0088 and the absence
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0089 of a shared compelling vision of the future
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0090 we can each learn from the problems of the
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0091 but i am optimistic about both i think we will on top of our issues
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0092 and i the europeans and particularly in the european union
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0093 pull through
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0094 looking at the competition between the united states and emerging global powers like china india russia
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0095 does america still need europe or does it need europe even more today
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0096 you mentioned china
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0097 india as the emerging powers
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0098 look more closely one of them is an emerging
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0099 the two others are not
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0100 is struggling with a nostalgia for the past
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0101 and the other one
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0102 has a somewhat exaggerated opinion of itself
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0103 given overall socio economic condition but a great potential
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0104 there is one emerging power and china
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0105 and of course we have to pay attention to it
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0106 but europe
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0108 our principal global ally
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0109 and has potentially a great vitality
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0110 with which to contribute meaningfully to the global condition provided the europeans
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0111 seriously the question of what kind of future they want
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0112 some
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0114 of nostalgic
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0115 to turn backwards
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0117 and europe needs today
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0118 much more evocative forward looking leadership of the kind it had some decades ago
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0119 and today is lacking
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0122 with russia
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0123 was it as many observers a failure was obama too naive
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0124 was a total failure and
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0125 was
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0126 first was very limited just think of the name
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0127 there nothing terribly ambitious about
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0128 it from computer age
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0130 readjustment
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0132 but it is being pursued now in a much more difficult setting because of reappearance of putin
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0133 and putin number two
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0134 is much less effective and much less attractive
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0135 putin number one
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0136 he is preoccupied with the past
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0137 with
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0138 the great power worldwide

20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0140 those are unrealistic objectives
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0141 which in the end
20130101_20130531_en_aauw-0143 think going to see

20130101_20130531_en_aavz-0047 no shortage of
20130101_20130531_en_aavz-0048 the economy is a pressing concern

20130101_20130531_en_aavz-0054 is democracy at the level of the various european states but not when it comes to europe
20130101_20130531_en_aavz-0055 the european parliament does not have the powers it should have and the executive agency as in the european commission is not directly elected by citizens
20130101_20130531_en_aavz-0056 the professor says leaders also seek to learn lessons from other continents while european values must become part of the education curriculum
20130101_20130531_en_aavz-0057 the truth is that we talk about the european union

20130101_20130531_en_aavz-0062 there a great distance between the creation of policy and its implementation in the various countries
20130101_20130531_en_aavz-0063 the european population is disinterested
20130101_20130531_en_aavz-0066 there is no doubt many voices are needed to plan the future of

20130101_20130531_en_abbh-0037 times in the netherlands for instance
20130101_20130531_en_abbh-0038 at the same time the financial crisis

20130101_20130531_en_abbh-0058 they
20130101_20130531_en_abbh-0059 give people more
20130101_20130531_en_abbh-0060 to
20130101_20130531_en_abbh-0061 if

20130101_20130531_en_abbh-0063 if you
20130101_20130531_en_abbh-0064 give a chance on the market what will they do they will probably take another

20130101_20130531_en_abbh-0066 them so in the end this will cost authorities and society much more

20130101_20130531_en_abbh-0089 today coach laura is briefing him about how to use social networks to approach employers according to dutch law companies are recommended to between two and five percent of people with disabilities but there is legal obligation one third of people with disabilities are out of
20130101_20130531_en_abbh-0090 i think it would make a big change for me if companies were obliged to a minimum of five percent of people with disabilities hope the law will change so that many young people will be able to find a job not just myself but many others
20130101_20130531_en_abbh-0091 i think it makes sense for employers to hire people with disabilities
20130101_20130531_en_abbh-0093 to improve their image
20130101_20130531_en_abbh-0094 and demonstrate socially responsible

20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0007 you do something about uncertainties and certainly
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0008 our hope
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0009 that policymakers will address the uncertainties and will try to remove them as much as they can in two thousand thirteen so that confidence can be restored
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0010 investors can invest and
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0011 can

20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0018 no relapse
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0020 the policymakers have to keep the momentum continue the reform continue sensible tax consolidations continue and complete the financial regulation

20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0022 britain has thrown the situation into uncertainty were talking about uncertainty
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0023 and
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0025 the
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0027 hope that europe
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0028 does it its usual way that is deal with the hurdles
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0030 europe is much stronger when it is all together

20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0033 the chancellor from germany has indicated her determination to discuss competitiveness and as we know competitiveness is at the heart of many
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0037 we want to be
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0038 accountable just like anybody engaged in a public mission or in the private sector are all accountable and i think that the first measure of accountability to come up with the truth is to hide things behind the curtains or under the carpet
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0039 been a difficult decision but we have decided that we should be totally open to our membership and say you know as we constantly
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0040 we reassess we verify we check numbers our assumptions against the new reality now i submit that the new reality of
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0041 last year for instance was entirely different from the new reality of three four years ago
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0043 as we call them technically have indeed changed over time we want to recognise that to admit it
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0044 i would add thing
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0045 a set of measures reforms fiscal consolidations
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0046 are not decided just on the basis of a fiscal
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0047 one of the many many
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0048 that
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0049 included in a global assessment of the state of an economy
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0050 matter what
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0051 greece had to consolidate greece had to restructure greece had to adjust its
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0052 economic landscape and remove barriers and remove a lot of to growth so
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0054 the issue of greece a few months back you caused some outcry when you said that you sympathise more
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0055 african children
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0056 than with the greeks do you by that were you misinterpreted
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0057 regret
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0058 no
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0059 do not regret it i was returning from africa and had in my mind and i still do today
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0060 children of niger that i had who had teeny tiny little classrooms outside hardly any books and when the person me
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0061 what was i thinking of when i was waking up in the morning and whether i was very concerned
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0062 about the greek people i said i think first of the little kids in
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0063 and i added that it would be a good thing if all greek people were paying their tax i still stand by that and clearly now endorsed by greek authorities by the greek
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0064 by european
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0065 authorities and so on and so forth and there is a clear recognition that if the greek authorities actually collect all taxes due including in particular from the wealthy estates then the economy would be a lot better
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0067 we are talking about europe
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0068 a difficult situation the us
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0069 not much better where that leave china
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0070 geographically east
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0071 but in terms of contribution
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0072 global growth as a driving force
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0073 you know china is
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0074 to
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0075 deliver anywhere between seven and eight percent growth in two thousand thirteen it has now a new leadership team which has made it very clear that deliver on twelve th continual
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0076 of theirs that they will continue to
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0077 the economic growth model to be more domestically focused
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0078 china is clearly going to be one of the driving forces of global economy going forward so talk of a bubble is unfounded
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0079 i think should all be extremely to bubbles wherever
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0080 they are likely to originate and particularly when it comes to real estate because i believe estate coupled with financial bubbles can be devastating as seen for the last five years but i would say that
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0081 china is
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0082 mindful that and is clearly attentive to
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0083 much balanced growth
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0084 the drama the us over the fiscal cliff the ceiling
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0085 is also overshadowing a greater problem the massive unemployment are we forgetting unemployment in the world when we look
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0086 crisis
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0087 well i would observe first that unemployment in the us is getting better
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0088 the
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0090 two hundred million unemployed people around the world is a huge number and
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0091 for societies for the families
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0092 have unemployed people
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0093 a cause for huge concern
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0094 and
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0095 where everybody should really focus their attention making sure that growth will pick up because
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0096 two thousand thirteen will see continued
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0097 but recovery
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0098 that recovery is actually fueled by job rich growth and not just
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0100 i
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0101 respectfully doubt it and i
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0102 partner with him to make sure that that happen
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0104 the fact that joblessness creates great unrest
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0105 you see the unrest amongst the young people in world shaping out as we move into
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0107 those under twenty-five when you have a twenty-five percent
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0108 rate fifty percent
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0109 rate
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0110 for young people so they have twice as much frustration
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0111 and despair for not being able to enter the job market and that touches on the accountability principle that very keen about which i think will be
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0112 a major principle major aspiration going forward
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0113 society is accountable to those young accountable to make sure that they are educated that they get the education that will give them access to the job market and that that growth is actually fueled
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0114 with jobs
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0115 they can come in
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0117 you have geographical
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0119 issue not addressed properly with identifiable solid anchorage you have the eurozone where construction and reconstruction and
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0120 of the whole region is underway and has to be completed
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0121 and then you have the middle east which
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0122 going through a huge transformation which is affected by conflict
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0123 causing major problems of movement of population and refugees
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0124 and
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0125 clear effects on the stability of these economic zones you have a lot of territorial issues that often have to do with scarcity of resources
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0126 so all of those are risks that need to be addressed with goodwill and with cooperation i think what we most need going forward is cooperation
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0127 and policymakers wondering not just how they can fix their own domestic issues or how they rally support around national causes but
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0128 what does it have outside and how can we get the best benefit out of
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0132 from two thousand eight which was a difficult time
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0135 or just a world for women we are together in and we have to pull together
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0136 and
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0137 take ourselves too seriously and keep that little sense of humour and that little voice inside ourselves that keeps calling on being sensible humble and to others but sense of humour
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0138 is
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0139 key
20130101_20130531_en_abbn-0001 question to you is how do you imagine europe in ten years

20130101_20130531_en_abii-0019 for
20130101_20130531_en_abii-0020 the
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0001 your human
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0004 which gets to the heart of your activity
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0006 like to know how
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0007 works and what exactly it does
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0008 very simple question what does human rights watch exactly and
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0009 you function
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0010 human rights watch is a worldwide organisation that researches
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0011 documents human rights abuse violence against individuals
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0012 lawlessness against people then we publish this
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0013 everybody can find out is the truth and finally advocate for change that there should be the of law that everybody should have their rights
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0014 how do you guarantee that what people tell you is the truth because a lot of people could invent stuff
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0015 we recruit we believe the best of the best as researchers being experts on countries they
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0016 to the
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0017 to syria
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0018 go to russia they go to south
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0019 they go to china they go to all of the places where there is
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0020 war
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0021 repression discrimination and human rights
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0022 they undertake hundreds of
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0023 and there are reports then as we publish them every week new reports new press releases is footnoted to the
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0024 detail because we must be absolutely sure that what
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0025 is the truth and that is our strength we say
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0026 the truth as
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0027 it smelt it discovered it in the
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0028 can see results of research on the human rights watch website we have a question just arrived on the
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0030 do we have a clean house here in europe
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0031 in human rights watch concerned
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0032 with a worsening human rights situation in many european countries
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0033 i would say in three words this is connected to minorities being discriminated migrants having
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0034 their rights violated
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0035 and that the
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0036 minorities and migrants
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0037 are always more vulnerable in times of austerity ok i know this is a subject which interests mister
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0041 like to ask a question regarding what happens with the rape in india
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0042 what is the indian government intending to do and what can we do as european citizens in order to stop this problem
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0043 how can european citizens help and react against
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0044 happening to women in india with
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0045 the news over the last week
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0046 can do a lot as we speak europe is preparing for the
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0047 european union indian
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0048 dialogue the annual dialogue which also includes human rights and that one we believe
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0049 that europe must insist that not only has the laws
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0051 in reality corrupt police
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0052 corrupt judges corrupt leaders do not in reality
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0053 the rights of women
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0054 what we saw even after some of these horrific rapes was that some politicians religious leaders and others
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0055 sort of faulted the women
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0056 for this
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0057 this can not be tolerated the practice
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0058 culture has to change in india as in so many other countries in defending the rights of women
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0060 i come from belgium the arab
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0061 spring is
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0063 this situation
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0065 in arab countries
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0066 we for example are very critical of the
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0067 of
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0068 rights for
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0070 which is the country supporting some islamic movements
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0071 other countries
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0073 happens in these countries
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0074 by exposing is happening in a place like saudi arabia or for
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0075 in egypt where there is
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0076 a battle values
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0077 around all of this and help those courageous women who fight for their own rights and they fight for their won rights from saudi arabia to
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0078 or for that matter in the horrific civil war in syria we have to
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0079 the violations we have to help them
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0080 fight for their rights as equal
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0081 men
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0083 my name is lola i live in belgium in developing countries do women take positive initiatives to change their conditions
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0084 in the emerging countries
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0085 are women taking initiatives you have examples of women who are trying to change things taking things into their own hands can you give a few concrete positive examples
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0086 i think
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0087 the long and good trend is that more and more countries are opening up
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0088 education for women never before history so many girls
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0089 gone to primary
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0090 school college and getting university degrees
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0091 in many african
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0092 and latin american countries where it was unheard of to have
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0093 female leaders in politics there are more than before however
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0094 far far away
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0095 the equality that
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0096 women deserve and
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0097 in too many places they are discriminated in the labour market
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0098 academia and in life
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0099 ok a lot of people sent questions in mister
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0100 what you think will be the human rights issues in the future watching human rights for a long time what are the emerging human rights issues
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0101 in this
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0102 there are many
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0103 many of old issues like even torture
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0104 extra judicial
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0105 are still with us
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0106 we are now seeing the dramas of algeria of mali
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0107 and especially in the war of syria unfolding
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0108 the new
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0109 generation of human rights battles
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0110 to a large degree is around the freedom information the internet the internet is a great tool
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0111 opening societies opening up dictatorships but is also a place for surveillance for spreading false accusations and hate
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0112 so i think in
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0113 the battle for information and the battle for our minds is one of
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0114 the future battlefields
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0115 where our values human rights international
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0116 has to defended
20130101_20130531_en_abij-0117 thanks very much indeed
20130101_20130531_en_abik-0001 problems memorising mathematical formulae or just hate the subject
20130101_20130531_en_abik-0003 he rap and maths and produces his videos all by
20130101_20130531_en_abik-0004 i really like making music and made a lot of music in my time
20130101_20130531_en_abik-0005 i
20130101_20130531_en_abik-0007 all of a sudden mathematical formulas sound so easy
20130101_20130531_en_abik-0008 his songs are even used in maths classes school
20130101_20130531_en_abik-0009 even girls
20130101_20130531_en_abik-0010 fancy maths very much like this new formula
20130101_20130531_en_abik-0011 the
20130101_20130531_en_abik-0012 formula i instantly thought of the melody of the song so i have to learn the formula by heart
20130101_20130531_en_abik-0013 teachers also like the math
20130101_20130531_en_abik-0014 this pupil shows that maths can be cool
20130101_20130531_en_abik-0015 to
20130101_20130531_en_abik-0016 with
20130101_20130531_en_abik-0017 he shows that maths can be vivid and easy to understand
20130101_20130531_en_abik-0018 meanwhile johan has finished school and started university to simplify the complicated maths at university with his songs
20130101_20130531_en_abik-0019 linear functions pythagoras or binomial formulas go into the mix and emerge as catchy study aids
20130101_20130531_en_abik-0021 proof that making the numbers add up
20130101_20130531_en_abik-0022 can be cool
20130101_20130531_en_abil-0001 the
20130101_20130531_en_abil-0002 institute of oncology in barcelona spain has recently presented the results of a new technique for treating lung cancer one of the most widespread cancers especially in
20130101_20130531_en_abil-0003 ultra precise radiotherapy able to target a very high dose of radiation with maximum
20130101_20130531_en_abil-0004 even in very small lung tumors without damaging the surrounding healthy tissues
20130101_20130531_en_abil-0005 the main advantage of this technique is that is synchronized with the
20130101_20130531_en_abil-0006 lung normally difficult to treat with radiotherapy because moves when breathing
20130101_20130531_en_abil-0007 the the
20130101_20130531_en_abil-0008 is
20130101_20130531_en_abil-0009 then instead of seven weeks continuously treatment is done in a few short sessions is over at the most in two weeks
20130101_20130531_en_abil-0010 scientists plan to this technique in patients that cannot be treated surgically
20130101_20130531_en_abil-0011 because of their age
20130101_20130531_en_abil-0012 or the increased risk caused by other
20130101_20130531_en_abil-0013 in the past only thirty percent of the patients treated conventional techniques gained an extra two years now we obtain a seventy eighty percent survival
20130101_20130531_en_abil-0014 new technique has already been tested in more than seventy
20130101_20130531_en_abil-0015 since two thousand eight
20130101_20130531_en_abil-0016 and the results seem encouraging
20130101_20130531_en_abil-0017 when told that he had this illness then the doctor got to work and well now as if he never had anything
20130101_20130531_en_abil-0018 thanks to the encouraging results
20130101_20130531_en_abil-0019 scientists want to extend the technique to other types of tumors
20130101_20130531_en_abil-0020 such as liver bone or prostate
20130101_20130531_en_abim-0001 former england captain david beckham joined big paris on thursday on a five month contract the thirty-seven year old recently training with premier league club arsenal in a bid retain his fitness was the target of several top european teams but decided to extend his illustrious career in the french capital
20130101_20130531_en_abim-0002 very lucky i thirty-seven years old
20130101_20130531_en_abim-0003 and
20130101_20130531_en_abim-0004 offers more offers
20130101_20130531_en_abim-0005 in career

20130101_20130531_en_abjt-0008 as famous french actor
20130101_20130531_en_abjt-0009 it seems he was not too pleased
20130101_20130531_en_abjt-0010 sean connery i heard was very flattered in an asterix album
20130101_20130531_en_abjt-0011 souvenirs of
20130101_20130531_en_abjt-0012 his friend with whom he started asterix as a series french in the magazine in fifty-nine
20130101_20130531_en_abjt-0014 the
20130101_20130531_en_abjt-0015 duo were inseparable and together they made asterix a worldwide selling over three hundred fifty million copies
20130101_20130531_en_abjt-0017 owe to the public i owe it to them
20130101_20130531_en_abjt-0018 was the readers who made asterix successful
20130101_20130531_en_abjt-0020 so i decided that two new authors a writer and a cartoonist should carry the torch into the future
20130101_20130531_en_abjt-0021 the two who were chosen to over are didier conrad as the illustrator
20130101_20130531_en_abjt-0022 jean yves ferri as the writer
20130101_20130531_en_abjt-0023 first works and obviously we feel it not quite sense of my
20130101_20130531_en_abjt-0024 but that will come very soon
20130101_20130531_en_abjt-0027 in
20130101_20130531_en_abjt-0028 will not be forgotten as the city has honoured him by naming a room in the town hall after

20130101_20130531_en_abju-0001 iran has arrested sixteen journalists in the capital tehran accused of cooperating with foreign persian language media organisations
20130101_20130531_en_abju-0003 reporters without borders has accused iran of cracking on freedom of expression the organisation has condemned iran
20130101_20130531_en_abju-0004 following the arrest of
20130101_20130531_en_abju-0005 journalists in the
20130101_20130531_en_abju-0006 from reporters without borders monitors the well being of journalists in iran
20130101_20130531_en_abju-0007 from paris
20130101_20130531_en_abju-0008 mr
20130101_20130531_en_abju-0009 three days after the latest wave of arrests the iranian intelligence ministry issued a statement accusing those arrested of collaborating with the persian speaking media
20130101_20130531_en_abju-0010 iran according to you more arrests are expected why is that what are the reasons
20130101_20130531_en_abju-0011 in the statement we issued after the
20130101_20130531_en_abju-0012 were made the day now known as black sunday we said there is possibility of further arrests and we are saddened that the of intelligence of the islamic republic of iran is maintaining the position it has held for many years
20130101_20130531_en_abju-0013 they continue to accusations against journalists and this in our view not right and does nothing to address the crisis in iran
20130101_20130531_en_abju-0014 the fact of the matter is that despite all the red lines and all the existing censorship journalists in iran are trying to provide
20130101_20130531_en_abju-0015 information that the islamic republic regime cannot tolerate
20130101_20130531_en_abju-0016 reporters without borders human rights watch and more than two hundred iranian journalists at home abroad have also issued statements in protest over the arrests
20130101_20130531_en_abju-0017 reactions have any impact on the regime in iran
20130101_20130531_en_abju-0019 since then such actions against journalists have been commonplace
20130101_20130531_en_abju-0020 what is important is not to be silent
20130101_20130531_en_abju-0021 in these cases all human rights organisations iranian journalists at home and abroad can play an effective role by protesting against the arrests of their fellow journalists
20130101_20130531_en_abju-0022 we should emphasise the point that thirty-four years after the start of islamic rule iran is unfortunately one of the most places in the world to a journalist today sixty-two journalists and bloggers in
20130101_20130531_en_abju-0023 are in prison
20130101_20130531_en_abju-0024 apart from issuing a statement what other measures your organisation taking to prevent recent
20130101_20130531_en_abju-0025 from spreading
20130101_20130531_en_abju-0026 our duty is to report and disseminate the
20130101_20130531_en_abju-0027 regarding freedom of expression freedom of the press and freedom of information in iran two days ago global ranking for freedom of the press
20130101_20130531_en_abju-0028 and out of one hundred seventy-nine countries iran is ranked one hundred seventy-four
20130101_20130531_en_abju-0029 should we
20130101_20130531_en_abju-0030 a new wave iranian journalists flee country
20130101_20130531_en_abju-0031 unfortunately any system of suppression causes people to leave the country
20130101_20130531_en_abju-0032 a large number of journalists have been summoned and arrested in tehran and across the country
20130101_20130531_en_abju-0033 in the capital sixteen have been arrested so far
20130101_20130531_en_abju-0034 i think the move heralds a further crackdown on journalists
20130101_20130531_en_abju-0035 to leave the country
20130101_20130531_en_abjv-0001 french and malian forces retook timbuktu and gao this removing control of the niger river bend from jihadist
20130101_20130531_en_abjv-0002 the population greeted the development with joy italian

20130101_20130531_en_abjv-0005 russian rtr television reported
20130101_20130531_en_abjv-0006 on
20130101_20130531_en_abjv-0007 them
20130101_20130531_en_abjv-0008 the main market of gao is very near spot where the islamists whipped people or staged public amputations for transgressions of their reading of the koran
20130101_20130531_en_abjv-0009 troops from chad have come to mali to take up the tasks performed by the french among with a mission that has become even more difficult in that the jihadists have out of sight
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0001 ask any tourist from new york to beijing to name an italian monument the answer will probably be the
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0002 with nearly two years of history the amphitheatre built under the leadership of the roman emperors of the dynasty for circus games gladiatorial combats is the visited monument in the country almost five million take in its wonder every year
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0003 its popularity provides a benefit which is more down to earth for
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0004 generates some five billion euros each year
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0005 is also a symbol of how this unique resource is managed the budget for study preservation and management of the amphitheatre is just eight hundred euros a year
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0006 that money for cleaning of marble for instance and the study and cataloguing of the archaeological pieces found on the site
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0007 italy has no natural oil wealth but historical and cultural resource fashioned through twenty-eight centuries of an unbroken civilisation
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0008 it is a simple truth
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0009 difficult to translate into practice
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0012 and the rest the is safe
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0014 italy has the most number of classified unesco heritage sites forty-seven in all
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0015 and yet mere crumbs are allocated to manage this wealth in the last ten years the budget has been virtually cut in half from a little over two billion it has fallen to less than one and a half billion
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0016 is not surprising then hear more and more alarming information on the state of the
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0017 of this heritage
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0018 in recent weeks for example a red zone of fifteen meters has been imposed around the colosseum to protect passers by from any material which crashes down from
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0019 according to archaeologists the last two years many have as in the last ten years
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0020 was put forward to philanthropists entrepreneurs who would be willing to sponsor the restoration of
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0021 diego della valle the ceo of the italian leather goods
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0022 put twenty-five million euros for the colosseum
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0023 that sponsorship model has been copied and on january twenty-eight the fashion house fendi announced a deal of more than two million for the trevi fountain
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0024 the work to be paid for by the sponsorship is on hold at the
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0025 after a dispute over the awarding of the tender only the most paid for by the is continuing
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0026 there are also question marks over the whole of a company receiving publicity for its sponsorship on a heritage which belongs to the country
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0027 the director no conflict of interest
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0028 the colosseum needed sponsorship twenty years ago
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0029 is clear the department did not have the funds to deal with a complete restoration of the amphitheatre
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0030 twenty years on the situation has worsened so welcome to backing from a private company
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0031 the sponsorship agreement provides no possibility of advertising on the monument
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0032 of
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0033 the
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0035 for a few cents we sell off a private monument that represents italy and can be used for advertising and commercial operations
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0036 they say not like that but we have read the contract
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0037 they will cede the naming rights to third parties and other private
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0038 to be able to say friends of the
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0039 pending court decisions there is another serious and urgent problem traffic
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0040 despite a partial pedestrianisation zone more than two vehicles per hour pass
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0041 there are now at least three thousand cracks in
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0042 in pompeii near naples lie the remains of the city where the wealthy citizens ancient rome enjoyed holidays
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0043 seventy-nine
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0044 volcanic eruption of vesuvius froze in time twelve thousand inhabitants
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0045 frozen that is easier said than done because the second most visited in italy on the unesco list since ninety-seven has deteriorated inexorably
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0046 in two thousand ten the collapse of the house of the gladiators shocked the world and sparked shame the situation has not much
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0047 the day after our arrival a
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0048 due to the lack of proper drainage led to the collapse of modern retaining wall next to a restoration project
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0049 the european union has decided act alongside the italian state this month the european commissioner for regional policy johannes hahn gave the go ahead for the grand pompeii project to the tune of one hundred and five million euros
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0050 the grand pompeii project is very important opportunity as it will secure all the archaeological site
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0051 creating this security means restoration can go ahead in different buildings
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0052 in the coming years
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0053 keeping the whole city under control
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0054 work already in in some houses the house of golden cupids
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0055 re open to the public soon
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0056 but of the one thousand five
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0057 the sixty-six hectares which make up pompeii
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0058 in the hundred of the most important buildings
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0059 two dozen are closed either they are being
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0060 or they are hazardous and to lack staff fifteen are open under a rotation system
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0061 in the past we had a group
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0062 an office shared between architects
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0063 surveyors
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0064 and assistants
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0065 at the
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0066 we are than half that number
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0067 the problem is that on sixty-six hectare site for each of three daily shifts there are less than thirty supervisors
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0068 half of the site is open to the public and attracts ten visitors daily in ninety-seven there were two hundred seventy-nine working here today that number is hundred ninety-seven
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0069 staff who retire are not replaced
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0070 difficult to maintain on a daily basis ancient city and yet regular maintenance is the only solution
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0071 the grand pompeii project may be timely but it will do nothing to solve the
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0072 according to one architect
20130101_20130531_en_abjw-0073 once again they implement the project slowly but these projects probably only serve to be able to say we saved pompeii

20130101_20130531_en_abmc-0006 to
20130101_20130531_en_abmc-0007 of
20130101_20130531_en_abmc-0008 that
20130101_20130531_en_abmc-0009 when
20130101_20130531_en_abmc-0010 on
20130101_20130531_en_abmc-0011 the
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0002 they respond to the reported
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0003 israeli air strike on a syrian weapons base
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0004 have never heard of
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0005 that we will be responding
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0006 but we have said is that what israel has
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0007 is a serious issue
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0008 this air strike
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0009 i would call it
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0010 an intervention
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0011 inflicting
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0012 another country and another people
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0013 is not allowed by
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0014 conventions and by un conventions
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0015 so what israel has committed is against international rules and
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0016 and it may have serious
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0017 when i say serious consequences
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0018 syria is in a very sensitive
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0019 region
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0020 and if this
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0021 crisis spills over to other countries
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0022 we will be facing
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0023 a huge fire that will burn
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0024 wet and dry
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0025 this is a saying in my own language
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0026 wet and dry that
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0027 everybody will be burnt
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0028 by
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0029 the spillover of the crisis
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0030 to other
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0031 countries so how would that play who would be the actors
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0032 actions
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0033 that been taken by the zionist regime which they deny for the sense of fairness they do deny that
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0034 carried out this
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0035 they do deny it no they have
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0036 admitted they have
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0037 not what officials the sidelines of the conference said to
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0038 well we are basing our
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0039 information on what we have received from the syrian government
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0040 even the un has responded to this the un secretary general
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0041 if this has not happened how is it that the un secretary general has taken
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0042 position in this
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0043 so
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0044 looking at syria
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0045 if there is the fall of
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0046 as many people in the west hope and expect to happen
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0047 what you think will happen certainly that will lead a vacuum
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0048 and if there is a vacuum in syria
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0049 the integrity of syria will be undermined
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0050 and we will not be sure syria will be kept as an
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0051 country anymore this will be a source of instability in the region
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0052 and
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0053 that source of instability will initiate instabilities
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0054 all over
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0055 the region it will even go as far as probably central asia because the way
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0056 that
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0057 could lead the resolution of this issue is the government and the
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0058 sit down together and
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0059 the problem
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0060 the syrian community within the syrian people in other words we
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0061 syrian resolution of the issue we should not expect that this issue be resolved through prescriptions
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0062 ready made prescriptions
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0063 outside syria then
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0064 imposed on the syrian people that will not work us president joe biden said
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0065 earlier at this conference that the offer of direct negotiations with america remains open
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0066 if iran is serious about you serious about it would you welcome that when comes to
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0067 on certain subjects
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0068 thematic negotiations i would call
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0069 this time nuclear negotiations
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0070 there is no
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0071 line on this to ask you what your red lines
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0072 but
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0073 this negotiation can only
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0074 take place when
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0075 we
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0076 get
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0077 assurances that this time the us
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0078 comes forward with honest intentions
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0079 because
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0080 our previous experiences unfortunately
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0081 have
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0082 the
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0083 is that what made you decide continue with enrichment programme
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0085 you are seeking the capacity for an atomic
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0086 weapon
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0087 you hear
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0089 chuck
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0090 about all the old expressions every option is on the table
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0091 including the military option
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0092 perhaps israel has nuclear weapon
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0093 you look at
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0094 us action in the region
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0095 and perhaps
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0096 based on this argument
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0097 that is why would proceed that path a question of survival
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0098 we have said it
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0099 from beginning
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0100 nuclear weapon has no in our defence doctrine
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0101 for number of
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0102 reason is because of our religious tenets and principles our beliefs
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0103 also our leader has issued a fatwa a
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0104 religious decree
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0105 would forbid
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0106 to
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0107 go into
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0108 nuclear weapons development country the other aspect when we look at it from the
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0109 pragmatic point of view
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0110 suppose iran
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0111 one or two three or four rudimentary bombs can it really compete
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0112 a country like the us in this regard
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0113 it be on
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0114 with any other
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0115 country that has been in this
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0116 developing nuclear weapons decades
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0117 will not be a deterrent for us
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0118 because
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0119 with our neighbours we have no problem
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0120 many called experts state very frequently in western
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0121 and elsewhere
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0122 iranian foreign policy is to wipe israel off the map
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0123 so i am looking for
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0124 a very clear and
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0125 statement that is completely false we do not recognise the state of israel
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0126 we have spoken of obliterating
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0127 when we said when i said when comes to using
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0128 weapons of mass destruction
20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0129 we have completely denied ourselves this right will you for the presidency of

20130101_20130531_en_abmd-0131 no i am not fit for that

20130101_20130531_en_abmf-0004 confidence
20130101_20130531_en_abmf-0005 to allegations of political corruption within the ruling party pp he broke silence saturday to defend reputation he would not respond to from the media but he rejected that he himself had any part in an alleged slush fund
20130101_20130531_en_abmf-0006 said i need more than two words
20130101_20130531_en_abmf-0013 we ask him to quit as head of government
20130101_20130531_en_abmf-0014 to give way to another
20130101_20130531_en_abmf-0015 who can restore the strength credibility and stability that our needs
20130101_20130531_en_abmf-0017 not enough to show his income tax because we are talking about
20130101_20130531_en_abmf-0018 money what we need is his resignation because those in public positions should set an example and they are doing exactly the opposite
20130101_20130531_en_abmf-0020 he is scheduled to appear in court for second later this month accused of misuse of millions of euros in public funds
20130101_20130531_en_abmf-0021 a political science professor at the autonomous university of madrid former head of the sociological research centre
20130101_20130531_en_abmf-0022 also a contributor to the el pais newspaper
20130101_20130531_en_abmf-0026 is enough to save him in the position he occupies today
20130101_20130531_en_abmf-0027 on the other hand resignation might be a bit hasty
20130101_20130531_en_abmf-0028 i think he should be allowed a measure of presumption of innocence
20130101_20130531_en_abmf-0029 has categorically denied the allegations
20130101_20130531_en_abmf-0030 he
20130101_20130531_en_abmf-0031 his party
20130101_20130531_en_abmf-0032 will
20130101_20130531_en_abmf-0033 today it obvious that of the things unveiled by
20130101_20130531_en_abmf-0034 have turned to be true
20130101_20130531_en_abmf-0035 this makes things
20130101_20130531_en_abmf-0036 really complicated
20130101_20130531_en_abmf-0037 the scandal triggered by the el pais revelations on the alleged payments to pp leaders has erupted in the middle of an economic crisis with millions of spaniards out of work and the son in law
20130101_20130531_en_abmf-0039 is spain facing an institutional crisis that is also affecting the monarchy
20130101_20130531_en_abmf-0040 is no about it

20130101_20130531_en_abmf-0046 political parties has fallen drastically
20130101_20130531_en_abmf-0047 these corruption cases are surfacing in a climate of discomfort that is much more far reaching than the scandals themselves
20130101_20130531_en_abmf-0049 i think that there will be a before and after
20130101_20130531_en_abmf-0050 in spain
20130101_20130531_en_abmf-0051 in terms of assessing corruption
20130101_20130531_en_abmf-0052 and from now on there is going to zero tolerance for this kind conduct
20130101_20130531_en_abmf-0053 we can claim a moral
20130101_20130531_en_abmf-0054 today that is as developed as that of the scandinavians that we might see in those countries if they had this sort of public ethical problems
20130101_20130531_en_abmf-0056 the people will not put up with any cases this

20130101_20130531_en_abnl-0020 but it sees a higher risk of conflict in countries where natural resources

20130101_20130531_en_abnl-0030 briefly do you think of this report
20130101_20130531_en_abnl-0031 this nic report is based on a question how powerful will america be in thirty the answer is slightly ambiguous
20130101_20130531_en_abnl-0033 forty-five
20130101_20130531_en_abnl-0035 to put it simply the scenarios are either regression cooperation or disintegration

20130101_20130531_en_abnl-0037 certain that in the end the americans and all other as well

20130101_20130531_en_abnl-0043 then it will play a positive role
20130101_20130531_en_abnl-0044 if it is threatened in its economic
20130101_20130531_en_abnl-0045 if it manage to control its ageing

20130101_20130531_en_abos-0005 i think is a sad day for european football
20130101_20130531_en_abos-0006 we have known for some time that organised crime operates many parts
20130101_20130531_en_abos-0007 of illegal economy
20130101_20130531_en_abos-0008 society and citizens in very many different ways the first time
20130101_20130531_en_abos-0010 evidence that organised crime is now also

20130101_20130531_en_abos-0017 which found matches were rigged
20130101_20130531_en_abos-0018 not champions league matches but domestic fixtures targeted by criminals
20130101_20130531_en_abos-0019 so yes clearly matches have been fixed
20130101_20130531_en_abos-0020 should we really be surprised by these revelations
20130101_20130531_en_abos-0021 what is new is the number of people involved
20130101_20130531_en_abos-0022 over four hundred from all levels of the game players and officials
20130101_20130531_en_abos-0023 of course organised crime
20130101_20130531_en_abos-0024 sporting bodies like
20130101_20130531_en_abos-0025 cooperate with the authorities
20130101_20130531_en_abos-0027 so no surprise
20130101_20130531_en_abos-0028 the extent is the surprise
20130101_20130531_en_abos-0029 has the integrity of football been undermined by these
20130101_20130531_en_abos-0031 not every game is fixed
20130101_20130531_en_abos-0032 what is alarming are the diverse number of actors involved especially criminals
20130101_20130531_en_abos-0033 as we have seen from the europol probe and recent scandals in italy
20130101_20130531_en_abos-0034 it stems from organised crime in asia with links to the balkan mafia
20130101_20130531_en_abos-0035 exactly the investigation looks at betting
20130101_20130531_en_abos-0036 is lack of supervision or just lack on controls on betting
20130101_20130531_en_abos-0037 there is an illegal market that has grown using new techniques
20130101_20130531_en_abos-0038 it is powered by the visibility of sporting events of all kinds
20130101_20130531_en_abos-0039 football in particular
20130101_20130531_en_abos-0040 and other sports tennis cricket etc
20130101_20130531_en_abos-0041 competitions are becoming increasingly something to bet on
20130101_20130531_en_abos-0042 that
20130101_20130531_en_abos-0043 illegal betting
20130101_20130531_en_abos-0044 controls must be tightened up and
20130101_20130531_en_abos-0045 between authorities and governments
20130101_20130531_en_abos-0046 why football

20130101_20130531_en_abos-0048 example
20130101_20130531_en_abos-0049 a fact that human resources and hardware are being directed at this problem
20130101_20130531_en_abos-0050 and then we see how sports resources are pooled to fight against this scourge
20130101_20130531_en_abos-0051 all the stakeholders must be engaged including the bookmakers
20130101_20130531_en_abos-0052 they play a key role
20130101_20130531_en_abos-0053 are responsible for their business
20130101_20130531_en_abos-0054 the initiatives currently undertaken by the council of europe can help in that regard

20130101_20130531_en_abot-0016 injury but it is consistent with something similar to a halberd

20130101_20130531_en_abpb-0001 first visit by an iranian to egypt in more than thirty years seems to confirm a thaw in relations after the election of president mohammed morsi in cairo

20130101_20130531_en_abpb-0003 mubarak before him a staunch ally of us stood against iran that time
20130101_20130531_en_abpb-0004 the rupture between iran and egypt came when egyptian president anwar signed a peace treaty israel in seventy-nine recognising its right to exist
20130101_20130531_en_abpb-0005 iran held a grudge
20130101_20130531_en_abpb-0006 that same year the revolution in iran and the islamic republic was born as the shah went into exile offered hospitality by egypt
20130101_20130531_en_abpb-0007 iran is predominantly shiite muslim and egypt sunni muslim
20130101_20130531_en_abpb-0008 regional alliances are heavily influenced by this for instance iran was the only organisation of islamic cooperation member to protest when syria expelled
20130101_20130531_en_abpb-0009 the region simply compared is eighty percent sunni and percent shiite
20130101_20130531_en_abpb-0010 the orange shading here shows that the shiites are mostly concentrated in iran and iraq
20130101_20130531_en_abpb-0011 egypt and powerful saudi arabia ninety and ninety-seven percent sunni respectively
20130101_20130531_en_abpb-0012 but syria and bahrain are gripped in more complex tensions syria is three quarters sunni but the shiite derived alawites eleven percent of the population hold the power in the hands president bashar al assad
20130101_20130531_en_abpb-0013 bahrain is ruled by a sunni king although most of the population is shiite less than one third sunni

20130101_20130531_en_abpb-0015 interest in supporting assad is not to let syria succumb to sunni predominance

20130101_20130531_en_abpb-0018 bahrain is buckling political tensions and analysts suspect tehran is actively supporting shiite pressures being brought on the sunni king
20130101_20130531_en_abpb-0019 this has also weighed on relations between iran and saudi arabia and gulf monarchies
20130101_20130531_en_abpb-0020 iran is intent on maintaining and increasing its in the region following the turmoil in iraq sunni states hope to counter that influence but this sort of cold war could heat up at any time these are the high stakes of any thaw between traditional adversaries

20130101_20130531_en_abrn-0008 i wanted new goals new challenges
20130101_20130531_en_abrn-0009 so i had to leave for a new championship and country
20130101_20130531_en_abrn-0011 i had offers from england italy and spain the leagues
20130101_20130531_en_abrn-0012 but no deal done
20130101_20130531_en_abrn-0013 the only done deal was

20130101_20130531_en_abrn-0029 was never my intention to be the star of the team
20130101_20130531_en_abrn-0030 i want to help zenit win trophies and i need help from my teammates and the club

20130101_20130531_en_abrn-0038 the captain and the other players and
20130101_20130531_en_abrn-0045 i was
20130101_20130531_en_abrn-0048 did you lose motivation
20130101_20130531_en_abrn-0050 fan forum published a manifesto its website calling for a team without black or gay players i quote we are not racists but for us the lack of black players at zenit is just an important tradition
20130101_20130531_en_abrn-0051 the identity of the club how do you feel that
20130101_20130531_en_abrn-0052 we are there play regardless of colour can be black white blue or yellow we are the same all flesh and
20130101_20130531_en_abrn-0055 only know the fans who back the team for ninety minutes they encourage me and my name so i have a positive view of zenit fans and i have no problems

20130101_20130531_en_abrq-0016 actually
20130101_20130531_en_abrq-0017 and
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0001 tunisia and egypt are emblematic of the arab spring
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0002 both similarities and contrasts have marked their paths
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0004 a secularist human rights activist
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0006 has been mohamed
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0007 candidate of the muslim brotherhood
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0008 people both countries elected each democratically
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0009 the first time the chance after getting rid of their respective dictators
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0010 ben ali in tunisia and mubarak in egypt
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0011 the tunisian vote handed the islamists a forty-two percent majority of parliamentary seats so they are the senior partner in a coalition government with the secularists
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0012 as the prime minister
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0013 but hopes swiftly soured replaced with disappointment
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0014 returned becoming more and more violent
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0018 this is in our houses this is the
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0020 the assassination of
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0022 election to office with nearly fifty-two percent of the vote showed how divided egypt still was
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0025 they say radical members of the brotherhood have infiltrated the security forces the
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0027 dissenters still get beaten
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0028 there have been accusations of torture
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0029 to take stock of the situation in
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0032 the fallout of this assassination on the political stage in tunisia
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0034 the second consequence is that this assassination is going to deepen the atmosphere of frustration and division while the people have some very big political expectations
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0035 the
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0037 to what extent does this party bear responsibility
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0039 besides latter have already
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0040 their intention to assassinate political figures
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0042 is what is happening today in egypt and tunisia the result of a failure of islamist parties in power
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0043 the situation in tunisia resembles enormously that in egypt we observe this failure of governments and of political parties emanating from elections at the same time the other political parties not acted in a convincing enough manner to be able to succeed at the next elections
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0044 should we fear a similar
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0045 to
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0046 in the
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0047 happening in tunisia and egypt
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0048 the events and particular circumstances are different but after october eighty-eight and the arrival of the islamic salvation front and other extremist groups assassinations of public figures multiplied just because they had said no to keeping people in the dark in that sense there is a resemblance tunisia and egypt
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0049 but what is positive is that these two countries can learn lessons from what happened in algeria in so as the algerian government at the time closed its eyes to the abuses against civilians political parties and intellectuals
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0002 so car giant has decided to go global on the one hand by merging with american auto maker chrysler on the other by investing in innovation especially in its plants abroad
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0003 the company has recently invested one billion euros in factory to buy machinery needed to produce two new car models
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0005 while there is growing concern among the trade unions that many people could lose their jobs due to outsourcing these workers are trying to stay positive
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0006 their hopes investment of this kind help his keep up in a competitive and innovative environment
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0007 two extra models at the moment we are producing one here
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0008 so we hope there will be enough work for everybody because this region depends on
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0009 and its
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0011 management calls it internationalisation but to some it looks more like outsourcing
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0014 asked whether is concerned about the risk of
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0015 italy says
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0016 that will happen
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0017 because they rooted italy and is considered as a product made in italy
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0019 are prepared to change some of the that in place for years
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0020 they need to work on saturdays work on saturdays
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0021 we must be competitive in the global market
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0022 but unions are sceptical about the job opportunities offered by a global market
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0025 of
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0026 the
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0027 productivity in italy are among the lowest in the
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0028 managers blame union opposition to labour reforms
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0030 the
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0031 we thought it would be easy for developed countries to go global
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0032 italy was those countries
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0033 the sixth or seventh most industrialised country in the world
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0034 we thought that emerging countries would just make quality goods
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0036 european and italian technological standards
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0037 that was a mistake it was short term thinking
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0038 without a comprehensive project on the future of car industry
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0039 economies will be the only beneficiaries of the outsourcing of production lines from italy
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0040 serbia for instance they are making a model that could have been produced in italy
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0041 we are in the city
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0042 serbia
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0043 here
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0046 welcomes the change
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0048 cold it was very hard work
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0049 when came everything changed the facilities and the
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0050 were lighter was renovated warmer
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0051 i could go to work knowing i would be warm and not be cold while i worked
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0052 son also found a job with
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0054 and have been there ever since
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0055 plant they earn between three fifty and four hundred euros per month slightly above the average serbian salary
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0057 since the end of the war and the transition from the embargoed socialist system to a market economy serbian productivity has grown dramatically but according to
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0058 there are reasons for investing
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0062 to do things differently
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0064 i am not an expert in italian labour law
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0065 we are dealing with two contexts
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0067 there are other to justify our investment here
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0068 such as the possibility to reach
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0069 worldwide
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0070 the location of the plant
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0071 our previous experience collaborating with serbia and a package of advantages offered by the government
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0072 if is an example to go by what italy is a comprehensive set of
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0073 based on compromise between management and workers and boosted by political decisions
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0074 the italian elections may seem far away for the
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0075 family
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0077 that too is the internationalisation of a market economy
20130101_20130531_en_abrt-0001 alarmed but not surprised at
20130101_20130531_en_abrt-0002 president of the world anti doping agency john
20130101_20130531_en_abrt-0004 the providers and suppliers of the illegal drugs the performance enhancing drugs and even those involved match fixing that underworld is one and
20130101_20130531_en_abrt-0005 the
20130101_20130531_en_abrt-0006 they to all three i guess i was naive enough to think
20130101_20130531_en_abrt-0011 has prompted several governing bodies to launch their own probes their
20130101_20130531_en_abru-0001 just a year to go until the winter olympics in russia
20130101_20130531_en_abru-0002 vladimir putin and the president of the international olympic committee
20130101_20130531_en_abru-0003 a ceremony at the ice palace in sochi
20130101_20130531_en_abru-0004 the olympics are a priority for putin who hopes to show how far russia has come since the of the soviet union in
20130101_20130531_en_abru-0005 but the preparations have been far from straight
20130101_20130531_en_abru-0006 many of the venues remain unfinished and been stories of corruption and construction delays
20130101_20130531_en_abru-0007 as a result of this putin sacked top russian olympic official
20130101_20130531_en_abru-0008 after publicly ridiculing him in front of television cameras on wednesday this is already set to be the most expensive games ever the cost expected to reach around thirty-seven billion
20130101_20130531_en_abru-0009 five times the original estimate are also concerns regarding a nearby islamist insurgency as well as worries about environmental damage allegations that some workers have been underpaid
20130101_20130531_en_abrv-0001 heard that one in five women is the of in europe is that
20130101_20130531_en_abrv-0002 and what can be done about
20130101_20130531_en_abrv-0003 it
20130101_20130531_en_abrv-0005 to be exact one in women is the victim of domestic violence to say the perpetrator is the husband
20130101_20130531_en_abrv-0006 or former partner
20130101_20130531_en_abrv-0007 which means there are many other forms of violence inflicted on women
20130101_20130531_en_abrv-0008 for example if you look at rape in belgium the police
20130101_20130531_en_abrv-0009 eight
20130101_20130531_en_abrv-0011 we want to raise awareness about this issue at a european level the level we work at
20130101_20130531_en_abrv-0013 women are beaten or killed
20130101_20130531_en_abrv-0014 it is said that every day in europe
20130101_20130531_en_abrv-0015 women die at the hands of partner husband or former husband
20130101_20130531_en_abrv-0016 seven women killed each day this has to stop
20130101_20130531_en_abrv-0017 we are asking europe implement a european strategy so that all women enjoy the same kind of protection
20130101_20130531_en_abrv-0018 a european strategy which would include both legislation and an action
20130101_20130531_en_abrv-0019 we want a european year against violence we want to raise awareness
20130101_20130531_en_abrv-0020 we want people to talk about it in order
20130101_20130531_en_abrv-0021 to improve prevention

20130101_20130531_en_abuc-0020 and the first results are promising

20130101_20130531_en_abuc-0034 hungry we
20130101_20130531_en_abuc-0035 but the final outcome of the research is not only to fight against

20130101_20130531_en_abuc-0041 good
20130101_20130531_en_abuc-0042 there was no
20130101_20130531_en_abuc-0043 of flavour
20130101_20130531_en_abuc-0044 in textures or like that was very enjoyable so
20130101_20130531_en_abuc-0045 if in the future
20130101_20130531_en_abuc-0046 developed that looks the same and feels the same of course i
20130101_20130531_en_abuc-0047 try
20130101_20130531_en_abuc-0048 researchers hope to see these

20130101_20130531_en_abud-0014 an audition is
20130101_20130531_en_abud-0015 sometimes harder and more challenging than
20130101_20130531_en_abud-0017 actors and actresses from different european countries she gets to rub shoulders with the creme de la creme of cinema at the berlin film festival
20130101_20130531_en_abud-0018 a chance for her to make a name herself outside of her country but how do you make an impression on a casting director

20130101_20130531_en_abud-0037 in romania you can work without an agent but
20130101_20130531_en_abud-0038 is very difficult so without

20130101_20130531_en_abud-0040 actors like musicians and other artists struggle to export their talent outside of their own country

20130101_20130531_en_abud-0047 i think i will really enjoy this ride
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0001 is one of the last icons of italian cinema and theatre
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0002 franco zeffirelli who turns ninety this year welcomes us inside his home
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0003 zeffirelli rose to fame in the
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0005 franco
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0007 maestro zeffirelli if you were to shoot a film on italy today how would you depict your country for rest of the world to understand it
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0008 what kind of film would you
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0009 the key words that best describe italy are still the same
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0010 what emerges throughout the country
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0014 we italians all too often neglect the fact that we gave the world a number of discoveries
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0015 not only artistic but also scientific
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0016 and in the fields of medicine and astronomy
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0017 do you like italy as it is today
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0018 italy today has the appearance
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0019 of a world power and it is
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0020 in a way from an economic point of view
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0021 but there is also a great confusion of opinion
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0022 and a ridiculous number of political parties
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0023 in the first years of our democracy there were two clear sides in those days the world was also divided in two on the side communists and on the other the capitalists
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0024 you experimented with politics with forza italia the party founded by silvio berlusconi you were elected senator
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0025 what memories do you have of that time
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0027 of the italian people
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0028 the of a certain political philosophy
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0029 opposed to fascism
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0030 generally politicians should not get involved in culture
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0031 because it just makes them look foolish
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0033 if you were culture minister today what would you do
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0034 i would open schools everywhere so that young people would no longer be entrusted to teachers who give them a mistaken view of society
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0036 all too often we neglect the responsibility that is ours
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0038 are
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0039 in touch with silvio berlusconi
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0040 yes i like
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0041 of course he has flaws but i like them
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0042 the problem with flaws is that you either like them or not
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0046 you have plans for a museum in florence
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0047 i am currently working on a project to set up a foundation that would be named after me
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0048 have had a long and rich life
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0050 i want to leave behind everything i have done so that others can benefit from it
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0051 at the heart this foundation will be a permanent exhibition on everything i have done in
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0052 you enjoy world wide recognition which actors or artists did you get along with best
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0053 the job of an actor is very
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0054 because it gives human beings the opportunity to break down the barrier of reality and open up world of fantasy
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0055 theatre is a like a door which allows people to on dreams to each other
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0056 when an audience goes to see a show it is bewitched
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0057 a great actor allows each member of the to understand what is hidden deep inside him
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0058 best represents italy the
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0059 there are many
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0060 but for me personally
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0061 i am totally enslaved to la
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0062 when i listen to it i stop anything i am doing
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0063 and i am transported into the wonderful memory of that piece
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0064 by the extraordinary
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0065 who was puccini
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0066 much maestro and finally can you tell us what are your hopes for italy
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0067 we can do anything we want
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0068 as long as we make good use what destiny blessed us
20130101_20130531_en_abue-0069 with his qualities spiritual and creative energy each man can create his own little paradise
20130101_20130531_en_abuf-0002 asked for her assessment of resignation
20130101_20130531_en_abuf-0004 the
20130101_20130531_en_abuf-0005 is
20130101_20130531_en_abuf-0006 surprising or the timing of
20130101_20130531_en_abuf-0010 the pope referred to physical and also
20130101_20130531_en_abuf-0011 problems but everybody wants to know if
20130101_20130531_en_abuf-0012 is
20130101_20130531_en_abuf-0013 the
20130101_20130531_en_abuf-0014 already said i would never leave the church at a difficult time but if i felt unable to be a guide for the church i would resign so his position was very clear right now he feel able to go on anymore for physical reasons
20130101_20130531_en_abuf-0018 we even have people thinking the pope wanted to resign some time ago and he wanted to wrap up this
20130101_20130531_en_abuf-0019 affair to put in order before he resigned
20130101_20130531_en_abuf-0020 who could the next pope after benedict
20130101_20130531_en_abuf-0021 and why
20130101_20130531_en_abuf-0022 another european but all this is new even for analysts used to following the vatican for twenty-five years like
20130101_20130531_en_abuf-0023 everything is unexpected new and original and we need to look more carefully at the facts rather than speculating and see what will happen between and twenty-eight
20130101_20130531_en_abuf-0024 and then in early march
20130101_20130531_en_abug-0002 all aspects of the sport he would continue to don his judo suit and take tatami
20130101_20130531_en_abug-0003 he said long as remains a pleasure to train to travel for the international tournaments with my team mates to live those
20130101_20130531_en_abug-0004 to want to reach my physical limits i will continue when i no longer feel the pleasure in it all stop
20130101_20130531_en_abug-0005 at the ripe old age of twenty-three is the most successful male judoka in the history of the sport but the talented frenchman remains hungry for success and any addition to his already swelling trophy cabinet would be a satisfying bonus
20130101_20130531_en_abug-0006 everybody wants my
20130101_20130531_en_abuh-0003 the under fifty-seven and the under sixty-three
20130101_20130531_en_abui-0001 the pope has resigned eighty-five year old benedict
20130101_20130531_en_abui-0002 astonished cardinals in the vatican with the surprise announcement in latin that he does not feel strong to head the roman catholic church
20130101_20130531_en_abui-0003 he said down on the last day of this month
20130101_20130531_en_abui-0004 papacy has been marked by controversy and
20130101_20130531_en_abui-0005 persistent revelations of child abuse by catholic priests
20130101_20130531_en_abui-0006 quit in
20130101_20130531_en_abui-0007 i think it does leave the church
20130101_20130531_en_abui-0008 the church has not really had a situation of two popes in many centuries
20130101_20130531_en_abui-0010 for people to forget that pope benedict is still alive and he is still perhaps writing still perhaps expressing himself
20130101_20130531_en_abui-0012 also with the frontrunners is canadian marc
20130101_20130531_en_abui-0013 but there are also names from latin america being mentioned raising the prospect that the leader of one two catholics will be from europe for the first time ever
20130101_20130531_en_abui-0014 the conclave
20130101_20130531_en_abui-0015 to on
20130101_20130531_en_abui-0016 the of
20130101_20130531_en_abuj-0001 shockwaves are being felt around the world following the resignation of pope benedict
20130101_20130531_en_abuj-0002 nowhere so in
20130101_20130531_en_abuj-0003 central rome
20130101_20130531_en_abuj-0004 that
20130101_20130531_en_abuj-0006 to
20130101_20130531_en_abuj-0007 even before
20130101_20130531_en_abuj-0008 election people were talking about a black pope so since then we have been waiting for black
20130101_20130531_en_abuj-0009 pope
20130101_20130531_en_abuj-0010 as speculation heats about might replace him the pope himself is expected to make a speech on
20130101_20130531_en_abuj-0013 the
20130101_20130531_en_abuj-0014 down and now everybody is keen to hear directly from him the reasons
20130101_20130531_en_abuk-0001 ordinary catholics reacted to varying degrees when word reached them about the head of their church many took a modern and rational attitude
20130101_20130531_en_abuk-0002 these responses were
20130101_20130531_en_abuk-0003 genuinely shocked when we heard yet the second
20130101_20130531_en_abuk-0005 big a disaster as people might think straight
20130101_20130531_en_abuk-0006 maybe they need somebody younger
20130101_20130531_en_abuk-0008 it will avoid the ordeal that happened the
20130101_20130531_en_abuk-0009 we are all
20130101_20130531_en_abuk-0010 you get old you get

20130101_20130531_en_abul-0009 and middlemen around

20130101_20130531_en_abum-0006 his pontificate was to be without controversy

20130101_20130531_en_abum-0008 as he was now called unleashed the first storm he was a speech in regensburg when he attributed more
20130101_20130531_en_abum-0009 to christian thought than to islam

20130101_20130531_en_abwm-0014 the catholic church a person who knew how to communicate in comparison to benedict whom to me seems a more timid
20130101_20130531_en_abwm-0016 this is who before he became pope was fraternising with leading intellectuals
20130101_20130531_en_abwm-0017 comfortable exchanging ideas with non believers or people with different religious views
20130101_20130531_en_abwm-0018 the importance of benedict
20130101_20130531_en_abwm-0019 was most of over ideas of our time

20130101_20130531_en_abwm-0027 a
20130101_20130531_en_abwm-0028 fact but not a legal one because vatican law allows for it
20130101_20130531_en_abwm-0029 is
20130101_20130531_en_abwm-0030 your favourite or best experience working with
20130101_20130531_en_abwm-0031 i remember the day before john paul died
20130101_20130531_en_abwm-0032 we knew he was dying he was suffering with breathing difficulties
20130101_20130531_en_abwm-0033 i recall the moment joseph ratzinger who was the oldest cardinal went into his room to say
20130101_20130531_en_abwm-0034 did he know that he was on the point dying
20130101_20130531_en_abwm-0037 which was very cold as the pope was suffering from serious circulation problems
20130101_20130531_en_abwm-0038 and he looked him in the and
20130101_20130531_en_abwm-0039 said the following
20130101_20130531_en_abwn-0001 what
20130101_20130531_en_abwn-0002 will leave to posterity and how he will be seen have contributed to the roman catholic church are questions being posed after the first pope since the fifteen th century decided to hand over the keys of saint peter on the last day of this month
20130101_20130531_en_abwn-0004 riccardi historian and the minister for international cooperation the government of mario monti
20130101_20130531_en_abwn-0006 in a way eleven february will remain a historic date
20130101_20130531_en_abwn-0007 linked to the departure
20130101_20130531_en_abwn-0008 who decided to go with a great lucidity and conscience
20130101_20130531_en_abwn-0009 many questions have been asked
20130101_20130531_en_abwn-0011 about his declining physical intellectual and
20130101_20130531_en_abwn-0012 strength
20130101_20130531_en_abwn-0013 because of
20130101_20130531_en_abwn-0014 they have looked for other reasons such as a crisis of church government or something like that
20130101_20130531_en_abwn-0015 i think difficult to be pope run the roman catholic curia the
20130101_20130531_en_abwn-0016 but there are no other reasons
20130101_20130531_en_abwn-0017 nothing hidden
20130101_20130531_en_abwn-0020 on the contrary
20130101_20130531_en_abwn-0021 the pope waited for the legal case against his butler gabriel to be over
20130101_20130531_en_abwn-0023 event
20130101_20130531_en_abwn-0025 elections
20130101_20130531_en_abwn-0026 the pope resigning has nothing to do with the italian
20130101_20130531_en_abwn-0027 but the people including non believers
20130101_20130531_en_abwn-0028 are closely linked to the papal figure
20130101_20130531_en_abwn-0029 a lot of people asking questions a lot of uncertainty how will manifest itself in electoral terms is difficult to predict
20130101_20130531_en_abwn-0031 to
20130101_20130531_en_abwn-0032 today the church needs a pope capable of helping it to grow and become stronger in
20130101_20130531_en_abwn-0033 the
20130101_20130531_en_abwn-0034 it needs a charismatic
20130101_20130531_en_abwn-0035 to guide
20130101_20130531_en_abwn-0036 but also man of government because the church is an international reality
20130101_20130531_en_abwn-0037 years the second vatican council laid the foundations for the church to be modernised in your opinion has time come for a new council
20130101_20130531_en_abwn-0038 has been talk about that once again
20130101_20130531_en_abwn-0039 ratzinger and many who think like him thought still had to assimilate the second vatican council
20130101_20130531_en_abwn-0040 anyway i believe we need thinking time maybe not a council but places for reflection
20130101_20130531_en_abwn-0041 which could help the church find the measure of its dimension
20130101_20130531_en_abwn-0042 since the church is so vast and very diversified
20130101_20130531_en_abwn-0043 from traditionalism to modernism how will history remember joseph ratzinger
20130101_20130531_en_abwn-0044 ratzinger has been described as a torquemada
20130101_20130531_en_abwn-0046 is a humble man
20130101_20130531_en_abwn-0047 his papacy was traditional very
20130101_20130531_en_abwn-0048 by the orthodox for his studies
20130101_20130531_en_abwn-0049 for

20130101_20130531_en_abzg-0006 but where the big gangs before had regularly tried to kill each other now were working with each other anti mafia
20130101_20130531_en_abzg-0007 piero grasso described this evolution of the many headed organised crime enemy which seems
20130101_20130531_en_abzg-0008 to reinvent itself in italy
20130101_20130531_en_abzg-0009 said the inquiry reconstructs the criminal relations in reggio calabria
20130101_20130531_en_abzg-0010 this has emerged a united management of illicit business
20130101_20130531_en_abzg-0011 which works in favour of the gangs sharing the profits
20130101_20130531_en_abzg-0014 billion
20130101_20130531_en_abzg-0017 for seventy
20130101_20130531_en_abzg-0019 the mafia also continues to try to infiltrate legal economic activity
20130101_20130531_en_abzg-0020 such as fruit and vegetable distribution in ten
20130101_20130531_en_abzg-0021 to monopolise production in the south of italy

20130101_20130531_en_abzg-0025 working with the sicilian mafia
20130101_20130531_en_abzg-0027 one of the biggest distributors in italy
20130101_20130531_en_abzg-0028 the big three are also increasingly going global not only in europe but canada australia colombia and venezuela
20130101_20130531_en_abzg-0029 and the mafia business portfolio is expanding in bricks and mortar
20130101_20130531_en_abzg-0030 property
20130101_20130531_en_abzg-0031 is a way to launder money although the state has begun to step up confiscations
20130101_20130531_en_abzg-0032 joining us now is outgoing national anti mafia prosecutor piero grasso taken a sabbatical to run as a democrat party candidate for the senate for
20130101_20130531_en_abzg-0033 the
20130101_20130531_en_abzg-0035 is
20130101_20130531_en_abzg-0036 time now for an international approach to combating the mafia
20130101_20130531_en_abzg-0037 the mafia now a transnational phenomenon commits crimes and carries out operations in several different countries so we have to find the evidence in collaboration with other countries
20130101_20130531_en_abzg-0038 are there sufficient means on a european level to fight against organised crime and follow the money trail
20130101_20130531_en_abzg-0040 come to that conclusion after discussing with my counterparts
20130101_20130531_en_abzg-0041 we most of all need to do is seize and confiscate illegal gains and in order to do this our legislation has advanced
20130101_20130531_en_abzg-0042 but we need the same norms in all european countries as well as countries outside the bloc in order to certain countries from becoming a refuge for money laundering
20130101_20130531_en_abzg-0044 putting our in the pockets of the mafia a priority
20130101_20130531_en_abzg-0045 judging from experience what must the government now to continue taking the fight to the mafia and what will be your political proposals on a european level
20130101_20130531_en_abzg-0046 regarding italy like i we have very tough legislation but we need to refine it for example by adopting measures against money laundering and all those connected with such operations at all levels
20130101_20130531_en_abzg-0048 we also need to improve anti
20130101_20130531_en_abzg-0049 laws
20130101_20130531_en_abzg-0050 on an international level
20130101_20130531_en_abzg-0051 i think that we must try to export the italian model especially our norms regarding the seizure of property
20130101_20130531_en_abzg-0052 a number of have already adopted similiar systems
20130101_20130531_en_abzg-0055 the fight against the mafia is also a fight against mentality how can you go about this in your role as a member of parliament
20130101_20130531_en_abzg-0058 the mafia and politics too takes advantage of this and
20130101_20130531_en_abzg-0062 give everyone a better chance of survival

20130101_20130531_en_acbv-0037 to
20130101_20130531_en_acbv-0038 because it had
20130101_20130531_en_acbv-0039 arguments it was about the blacks the arabs but nowadays it

20130101_20130531_en_acbv-0046 in essence it leads to the same
20130101_20130531_en_acbv-0047 the outcome
20130101_20130531_en_acbv-0048 which is the exclusion of people
20130101_20130531_en_acbv-0050 a problem
20130101_20130531_en_acbv-0051 what i
20130101_20130531_en_acbv-0052 there is a problem in society i think the state must act

20130101_20130531_en_acdl-0007 began moving his hand all over her body
20130101_20130531_en_acdl-0008 my only thought was to attack but unfortunately we are used to this
20130101_20130531_en_acdl-0009 i can not walk in a street without being touched by someone it has become
20130101_20130531_en_acdl-0010 even though it is such a disgusting what can i do

20130101_20130531_en_acdl-0018 our correspondent in cairo
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0002 but he wants to introduce more pro growth measures in an attempt blunt mister
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0003 claims that austerity has halted economic recovery
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0004 is a staunch europhile calling for the creation of
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0005 of europe is also front runner in opinion polls ahead of the italian election
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0008 victory is certain berlusconi is very close overtaking you do you feel him breathing down your neck
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0009 first of all a year ago we did what we to do for italy
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0012 the right exists and berlusconi makes populist appeals he blows his own trumpet
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0017 crippled the very of europe its credibility
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0018 so yes perception is that we a responsibility to win
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0019 not only for italy but also for the whole of europe and not just for left wing europe
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0024 is a moderate liberal with lately some of the flavour christian democrat
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0025 he had from advisor david axelrod and so called gurus like him generally advise attacking your opponent and making promises
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0026 therefore we saw some kind of conversion we a new monti in front
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0031 against conflicts of interest and in favour of free and open markets
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0033 gender equality
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0034 the to education
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0035 the right of workers to have a say in the decisions made by a company and so on
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0038 how do you feel about leading italy without full support the financial markets
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0039 i believe the financial markets are not a variable that can be
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0041 the size of our economy makes us too big a country be with a bailout
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0042 so we must continue the recovery policies budgetary control stability
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0043 however the markets say we have enough growth we in too deep a recession and no one adjusts their budgets when they are in a long recession
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0044 so have to combine strict with growth policies
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0045 we ask for this to happen at the european level we should make it happen in italy
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0046 to have former anti mafia state attorney piero grasso for your party is a warning against organised crime and are you thinking about him as a possible minister of justice
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0047 piero is a personality of great importance and his presence indicates precisely my intention to declare war on crime and to take a strong stance against crime
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0050 a lot of things
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0051 unfortunately criminals are still around and their dirty economy is still penetrating the clean economy
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0052 the
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0053 your
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0054 as minister
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0055 that
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0056 there is no silver bullet
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0057 but certainly need to improve of the regarding work and temporary jobs
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0058 rules
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0059 create jobs work generated with consumption and investment
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0060 therefore my recipe is seek fiscal and economic policies which encourage private and public investment and re ignite consumerism
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0061 these are the main priorities if we really want to talk about employment
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0062 and in fourteen have to a target and put a plus sign front of our employment figures
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0063 in
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0064 italian elections
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0065 but if the centre right coalition conquers the
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0068 these are crazy and populist propositions by the league
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0069 these are policies that led to trouble and are inspired by a culture narrow mindedness regression and
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0070 is what they are
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0071 honestly i believe that the north of the country understood that all this is leading us nowhere
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0073 you find the right italy the people
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0074 i found a very angry italy but i think that at least the italy close us wants to bring about a change in government
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0075 this italy i that protests themselves will not take us anywhere
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0076 but even government without change will lead us nowhere
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0077 the synthesis between change and government is what we have been proposing while travelling across the land
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0078 we are a great popular party and we disregard an effective presence on the territory
20130101_20130531_en_acdm-0079 this is our atomic weapon and with this we

20130101_20130531_en_acfu-0032 that is while italian channels
20130101_20130531_en_acfu-0033 ridicule us as fools instead of presenting objective

20130101_20130531_en_acfu-0044 we do have economists inside the movement and we look for a solution because the debt
20130101_20130531_en_acfu-0045 our lives
20130101_20130531_en_acfu-0046 there is no money but is

20130101_20130531_en_acfu-0058 and am supposed respect whatever they do hang on a
20130101_20130531_en_acfu-0059 where is written
20130101_20130531_en_acfu-0060 angela merkel went to china to sell italian bonds not german bonds
20130101_20130531_en_acfu-0061 china took those credits knowing they were worthless
20130101_20130531_en_acfu-0062 because the italian government helped them to in italy very profitable fiscal legislation they buy our debt through merkel
20130101_20130531_en_acfu-0063 get real

20130101_20130531_en_acfu-0072 impossible
20130101_20130531_en_acfu-0074 not the soviet union
20130101_20130531_en_acfu-0075 here in sicily fishermen are obliged to use nets with large holes imposed by the eu
20130101_20130531_en_acfu-0076 these nets are useless so fishermen have to get illegal nets in order to survive
20130101_20130531_en_acfu-0077 and they are forced to destroy the environment
20130101_20130531_en_acfu-0078 they cannot tuna
20130101_20130531_en_acfu-0079 but the japanese can
20130101_20130531_en_acfu-0080 and they come here with fishing as big as aircraft carriers
20130101_20130531_en_acfu-0081 the comedian from genoa is the figurehead leading a team of politically untested candidates
20130101_20130531_en_acfu-0082 have big promises so many times feeling terribly let down the mainstream many potential voters undecided seemed caught in the glare
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0003 i ask you how and what colours you paint with to represent italy today
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0005 at best there are of purple orange and red
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0008 the crisis has destroyed any enthusiasm and joy
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0009 in your latest works is there any hope where is the hope
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0010 there is one positive thing
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0013 for the best solutions who look for new
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0015 jump into your past to talk about the prize for literature you won in
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0017 who are the powerful that dario fo castigates today and
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0018 the banks mostly and the big entrepreneurs
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0019 all those who hold the reins
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0020 show a show
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0021 those who through the media
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0022 television and in other ways
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0023 make every effort to ensure that people accept the conditions they find themselves in
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0025 what worries you the most
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0026 worried about the same things as the politicians because i feel like an outsider
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0027 tired of the way they think of the relationships between
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0029 who only risk their jobs
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0030 the
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0031 politicians have just into a workplace routine
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0032 they no longer have a mission
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0033 and this is accepted because the voters trust
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0034 them
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0035 is still possible to be passionate about politics
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0036 degraded in a very short time
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0037 been created over centuries
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0038 hope and trust have been destroyed
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0039 as well as the value of laws
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0040 the community
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0041 justice
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0042 especially justice
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0043 when and how did this destruction come about
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0045 and based primarily on culture and knowledge
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0046 which instils in the collective consciousness equality freedom and justice
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0047 collapses
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0048 there are many who praised the sleaze
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0049 real artists
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0050 not even worth naming anyone in particular
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0051 just look around you the first one you see
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0053 of
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0054 them
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0056 above all the

20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0073 just yesterday did a satirical performance drawn from buster
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0074 was about a statue in a large room
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0075 and all around there are

20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0088 must patient
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0089 one last question to finish what are your hopes for italy in the future
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0090 freedom
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0091 breaking free from any obstacle
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0092 hypocrisy and bondage
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0093 robs us of our
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0094 to become again master of our own lives
20130101_20130531_en_acfv-0095 is exactly i wish my
20130101_20130531_en_acfw-0001 whaam the tate gallery london is showing a major retrospective of work by pop artist lichtenstein who almost single handedly dragged the comics aesthetic into the world of high art
20130101_20130531_en_acfw-0002 in the
20130101_20130531_en_acfw-0003 he broke abstract expressionism and turned to mass culture imagery including comic strips and advertising
20130101_20130531_en_acfw-0005 comes out of a huge tradition of great painters he is in my mind the modernist painter of the twentieth century
20130101_20130531_en_acfw-0006 alongside picasso matisse and some of his peers from the sixties
20130101_20130531_en_acfw-0007 oldenburg and of course warhol
20130101_20130531_en_acfw-0009 one of his signature methods running through the show featuring works
20130101_20130531_en_acfw-0011 they can be found his famous comic images but also in landscapes and seascapes adaptations of well known works by other twenty th century artists nudes chinese paintings
20130101_20130531_en_acfw-0012 lichtenstein died in ninety-seven aged seventy-five lichtenstein a retrospective runs from february

20130101_20130531_en_acfx-0008 economic and social reality of our country is terribly tough and based on that we will act this
20130101_20130531_en_acfx-0009 just begun and road left to achieve our great objective for this legislation job creation is still
20130101_20130531_en_acfx-0010 i insist not a minute of rest
20130101_20130531_en_acfx-0012 is wholly responsible

20130101_20130531_en_acfx-0019 corruption is a problem that alarms the people and affects the image of spain
20130101_20130531_en_acfx-0020 all corruption is unbearable corrosive for civic spirit it injures democracy and discredits spain
20130101_20130531_en_acfx-0021 the government will propose parliament a law for the control of the economic financial activity of political parties
20130101_20130531_en_acfx-0027 the scandal and by doing
20130101_20130531_en_acfx-0030 eludes the issue seems to be
20130101_20130531_en_acfx-0035 which believe in him the european central bank merkel the bundesbank all believe in him but spanish citizens
20130101_20130531_en_acfx-0036 because he systematically failed to keep every single promise
20130101_20130531_en_acfx-0038 unemployment has continued to rise since has headed up the government for how long will he lay the blame for this at the door the socialist legacy
20130101_20130531_en_acfx-0040 state of the nation
20130101_20130531_en_acfx-0041 the state of national
20130101_20130531_en_acfx-0043 for him is uncomfortable reality now but he see it as a profound drama the worst outcome is that we see positive action taking initiatives that would allow us to know spain will find its growth what the paths are that spain must take to borrow and grow
20130101_20130531_en_acfx-0044 the that will provide the wealth to rescue spain from this situation
20130101_20130531_en_acfx-0047 who society actually regard with a great deal of suspicion we have problems with the image of the leadership of the state and of the crown as well as the image of justice

20130101_20130531_en_achb-0031 very clear
20130101_20130531_en_achb-0032 realised he no longer the energy
20130101_20130531_en_achb-0033 to govern the boat of st peter
20130101_20130531_en_achb-0034 and carry out the evangelical mission

20130101_20130531_en_achb-0037 that
20130101_20130531_en_achb-0038 and passes the baton to his successor

20130101_20130531_en_achb-0040 will become invisible

20130101_20130531_en_achb-0043 the scandals of the vatican bank
20130101_20130531_en_achb-0044 paedophile priests
20130101_20130531_en_achb-0047 clear that the thing that most affected him was the scandal
20130101_20130531_en_achb-0048 concerning the abuse of minors committed by members of the church
20130101_20130531_en_achb-0049 another perspective on this historic moment the director of catholic tv station sat two thousand
20130101_20130531_en_achb-0050 mr boffo in two thousand nine you were the victim of media attack by a berlusconi family
20130101_20130531_en_achb-0051 after this you the
20130101_20130531_en_achb-0052 of
20130101_20130531_en_achb-0053 catholic daily
20130101_20130531_en_achb-0054 do you believe today that resigning was the right choice
20130101_20130531_en_achb-0055 i say yes
20130101_20130531_en_achb-0056 at least in my case
20130101_20130531_en_achb-0057 was a winning solution
20130101_20130531_en_achb-0058 i left straight away at beginning in to find the truth
20130101_20130531_en_achb-0059 in the case of pope
20130101_20130531_en_achb-0060 it is quite different
20130101_20130531_en_achb-0061 he resigned for reasons related to his
20130101_20130531_en_achb-0062 he told himself that
20130101_20130531_en_achb-0063 can no longer cope with the challenges that the church and our times
20130101_20130531_en_achb-0064 he therefore prefers to the post
20130101_20130531_en_achb-0065 younger
20130101_20130531_en_achb-0067 on
20130101_20130531_en_achb-0069 new energy
20130101_20130531_en_achb-0070 a younger stronger pope can clearly give more to the church than
20130101_20130531_en_achb-0071 eighty-five old
20130101_20130531_en_achb-0073 on the contrary
20130101_20130531_en_achb-0074 could see he was his texts that his powers of thought
20130101_20130531_en_achb-0075 greater
20130101_20130531_en_achb-0076 that said
20130101_20130531_en_achb-0077 governing the church is not only related to the quality of your thoughts
20130101_20130531_en_achb-0078 but rather an intellectual energy
20130101_20130531_en_achb-0079 the ability to react take decisions quickly
20130101_20130531_en_achb-0080 the

20130101_20130531_en_achb-0086 i admit that this news surprised me a bit
20130101_20130531_en_achb-0088 if still a director at the military shipyards
20130101_20130531_en_achb-0089 desirable that immediately step down from

20130101_20130531_en_achg-0003 does this expression really mean and is it more efficient than when berlin speaks of federation
20130101_20130531_en_achg-0004 in my opinion opposed when
20130101_20130531_en_achg-0006 is underway the eurozone is painfully giving birth in difficult circumstances to an economic government
20130101_20130531_en_achg-0007 and that means more than just punitive measures inflicted on different member states who break budget limits by a central authority or by germany acting alone
20130101_20130531_en_achg-0010 in other words that has many different meanings and should be used with care

20130101_20130531_en_acju-0001 a more intelligent robotic hand is the goal of a european union research project just presented its results at pierre and marie curie university in paris
20130101_20130531_en_acju-0002 from six eu countries joined forces to make a hand that looks reacts and behaves
20130101_20130531_en_acju-0003 like the real
20130101_20130531_en_acju-0005 that are already quite complicated
20130101_20130531_en_acju-0006 humans naturally adapt their grasp placing fingers correctly to manipulate various objects
20130101_20130531_en_acju-0007 for robots it is a much tougher task learning from the human hand scientists made large
20130101_20130531_en_acju-0008 of various grips and movements
20130101_20130531_en_acju-0009 robot uses to get the required
20130101_20130531_en_acju-0011 and its movements need to be reproduced with high dexterity resembling our natural actions which is extremely difficult
20130101_20130531_en_acju-0012 using video cameras the robot studies its surroundings before planning its movements
20130101_20130531_en_acju-0013 from its database it chooses the right actions to complete the task successfully
20130101_20130531_en_acju-0014 it uses a colour camera that collects distance data to detect the required object and any possible obstacles
20130101_20130531_en_acju-0015 on the shape of the object it can determine how to seize it avoiding any collisions
20130101_20130531_en_acju-0016 thanks to fingertip sensors it can be sure that the grasp it has chosen is correct
20130101_20130531_en_acju-0017 as proof of its dexterity the robotic hand can rotate the object lifted from a surface
20130101_20130531_en_acju-0018 can be picked up just two fingers and then the hand modifies its grasp to hold it with three fingers while pouring the drink
20130101_20130531_en_acju-0019 the pressure feedback from fingers is particularly important when with delicate objects
20130101_20130531_en_acju-0020 hand has multiple degrees of freedom that allow it to address very fine and complex manipulation tasks giving it enough dexterity manipulate extremely
20130101_20130531_en_acju-0021 objects such as lightbulbs
20130101_20130531_en_acju-0022 scientists believe that human like robots can integrate more easily into our human designed world using the same objects we normally use
20130101_20130531_en_acju-0023 in many situations
20130101_20130531_en_acju-0024 they can give helping

20130101_20130531_en_acju-0027 manage to imitate human dexterity then we can imagine
20130101_20130531_en_acju-0028 that will be capable to work alone in dangerous environments such as nuclear objects
20130101_20130531_en_acju-0029 and much closer to home we could have robotic assistants able to help elderly or

20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0033 political situation in italy
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0034 with beppe grillo the protest vote
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0035 how can you from an economic standpoint
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0036 not entirely unexpected have this situation structural reforms are never that popular
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0037 also the social impact of the reforms is being felt by many
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0039 in a situation where the deep rooted economic problems which italy has
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0040 be tackled effectively when we have political deadlock
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0042 the big loser monti who came in behind grillo
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0043 does
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0045 think
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0046 was the same situation
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0047 call for
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0048 a
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0050 have a responsibility to govern
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0051 graham these technocrats were carrying out policy
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0052 that the eu was saying was
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0053 and the central bank saying was a good ie
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0054 the
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0055 deficit three percent gdp
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0056 they did accomplish certain
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0060 they were what were
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0061 largely needed for the italian economy and to satisfy the markets
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0062 how do you
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0063 see the formation of a how are they pull this off now
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0064 corina your
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0065 would perhaps
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0066 this
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0067 how find
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0068 some of coalition would be a grand coalition of
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0069 the president
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0070 we because he is leading in
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0071 of
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0072 now and
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0073 government
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0074 a grand
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0075 and
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0076 we will avoid what you in the beginning
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0077 and
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0079 down eventually by berlusconi and grill supporters i think a coalition
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0080 very difficult and very few people would trust berlusconi particularly view of what he did in bringing down mario government what i think
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0082 that italian elected politicians recognising the need for a majority in both houses of parliament actually come together to form some new party some new alliance the
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0084 who knows elections later in the year that could lead to any outcome
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0085 fabian how do you think we can avoid gridlock here the parliament
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0088 election
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0092 who the government they have to take action only to reassure their
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0093 but also the financial markets how are they going to do that
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0095 the highest for now is to become ungovernable and
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0096 i think it be
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0097 for the citizens for the country and for
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0098 the
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0099 now
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0100 the economy
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0101 the first thing
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0102 any new government should be doing in italy now i think if they want support of the financial markets which is be essential for investment
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0105 fabian this
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0106 has managed to bring
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0107 down three percent but we
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0108 unemployment
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0109 the european average how do you address that now especially after
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0110 so many people are fed up
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0112 investment in the italian economy
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0113 that there are impulses for
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0114 but
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0115 political
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0116 deadlock is
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0117 going to be wary to go in
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0119 to all three of you and
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0121 you see new elections italy before this year is out

20130101_20130531_en_acnw-0004 and particularly to avoid religious
20130101_20130531_en_acnw-0005 and above all to find common ground on which to work and in particular find universal values to which all believers can relate

20130101_20130531_en_acnx-0003 with the new title of pope emeritus but he preferred a more humble
20130101_20130531_en_acnx-0004 i am no longer the supreme pontiff of the catholic church i am simply a pilgrim who is starting the phase of his pilgrimage on this earth

20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0008 among the pressures the new appointee will face are mounting public demands to crack down meaningfully on priests accused of sexual abuse
20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0009 many accusations and substantial evidence piled up far wide over a long time including church cover ups
20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0010 the world will watch if the

20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0012 the
20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0014 they have plenty to talk about

20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0018 horizon will be cloudy

20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0022 time to choose
20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0024 i feel a great admiration and emotion towards pope benedict
20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0025 his great gesture of courage
20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0026 and humility and love for the and jesus christ
20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0027 at the general audience he said he had thought about this prayed and tried to comprehend
20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0028 he said he knew his action was serious
20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0029 and that he had taken it in great serenity
20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0030 because he had put jesus the good of the church before own
20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0031 during the conclave you will all have to take into account sensitive matters that the next pope will have to face paedophilia obscure financing
20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0032 will all that complicate your choice
20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0034 we must ask god who inspires us in our
20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0035 who has already chosen
20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0036 god already knows who the new pope is
20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0037 therefore we must not exaggerate the problems
20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0038 that church has had as there is a lot of
20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0039 i deny that there are problems
20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0040 even the pope asked for forgiveness
20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0041 said he was ashamed of these errors
20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0042 and certainly suffered in the affair of the leaked
20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0043 these are actions which are part of the history of human creatures
20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0044 even ecclesiastical figures who can have weaknesses
20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0045 these not to be generalised
20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0046 they do not impose conditions on choosing a person
20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0047 choice of the person has to be motivated by a
20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0048 vision of man suggested to us by god and
20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0050 i have a clean slate in front of me
20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0051 the man god suggests to us with his spirituality his faith his cultural pastoral preparedness must be of steering the church on the road of john paul and benedict
20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0052 will this take a long time possibly because of internal divisions among the cardinals
20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0053 is of my opinion that internal divisions in college of cardinals are an invention of journalists
20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0054 since immediately following the day on which the resignation announcement was made
20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0055 which is to say on february twelve
20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0056 certain italian newspapers already

20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0062 the outgoing pope benedict who has resigned who will always remain in our memory a pope decreed last year be year of faith
20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0063 called a synod on evangelisation last year
20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0064 expressly to remind everyone of the responsibility of spreading the gospels anew
20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0065 prevent a weakening of the faith
20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0066 especially in our countries which a very long catholic tradition like europe has
20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0067 to

20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0072 in their ministry
20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0073 wish for the coming pope is that he be rich in grace
20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0074 that he feel the support of the spirit of
20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0075 the grace of god
20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0076 and that he also feel the common force of all of us behind him
20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0077 will there be a new pope
20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0078 that still leaves a month
20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0079 i hope that the preparation work of the congregations of the conclave not last more a month
20130101_20130531_en_acoz-0080 it would cause problems if it went on for longer than that this is what i hope anyway

20130101_20130531_en_acpb-0020 if like to ask a question
20130101_20130531_en_acpb-0021 on the
20130101_20130531_en_acpc-0001 the united states is heading for deep spending cuts after democrat and
20130101_20130531_en_acpc-0002 leaders failed to break the deadlock over alternative plan cuts worth sixty-five billion euros were originally passed to force congress agree a budget deal to avoid the so called fiscal cliff president obama who must sign into law by the end of friday
20130101_20130531_en_acpc-0003 the economy time when our businesses have finally begun to get some traction

20130101_20130531_en_acpc-0012 that we have to deal

20130101_20130531_en_acpc-0017 worst hit by the cuts will be defence the military stands to lose thirty-five billion euros ten of its budget the impact will also be felt in education teachers will begin to lose their jobs as money runs out other workers face being laid off temporarily without pay
20130101_20130531_en_acpc-0018 cuts will take effect gradually leading some to think congress still has time to reach a deal to reverse the process
20130101_20130531_en_acpd-0001 tension in the air as the

20130101_20130531_en_acpd-0012 to go beyond the rhetoric
20130101_20130531_en_acpd-0013 and begin to take concrete steps

20130101_20130531_en_acrq-0017 of small movements
20130101_20130531_en_acrq-0018 the programme hopes to give back a bit of control independence and dignity to people like andrea or lorenzo
20130101_20130531_en_acrq-0019 and most importantly the technology is designed to adapt to the patient and not the other way

20130101_20130531_en_acrq-0024 the solutions for these patients contain elements which will be for millions of people

20130101_20130531_en_acrq-0038 i will volunteer
20130101_20130531_en_acrq-0039 do all these experiments again
20130101_20130531_en_acrq-0040 and maybe at that time possible to

20130101_20130531_en_acrr-0007 the robot gets better results conventional drug therapies because it can treat very small lesions less than four millimeters
20130101_20130531_en_acrr-0008 and because the abnormal cells are selectively destroyed rather than temporarily suppressed

20130101_20130531_en_acru-0002 is known as female genital mutilation a practice that is prevalent in many countries there are laws against it but that is not enough to resolve become a complex global issue
20130101_20130531_en_acru-0003 is
20130101_20130531_en_acru-0004 the focus of growing debate in africa and where most practised
20130101_20130531_en_acru-0005 but also an issue in the west with tens of thousands of cases among immigrant communities
20130101_20130531_en_acru-0006 france is one of many countries where is banned
20130101_20130531_en_acru-0007 action is also tough here

20130101_20130531_en_acru-0014 psychological consequences are very significant because they last a
20130101_20130531_en_acru-0015 and there are times when it really leads us depression but in our culture depression does not
20130101_20130531_en_acru-0016 or did not exist before just like a brief
20130101_20130531_en_acru-0017 when things
20130101_20130531_en_acru-0018 but i make the link between all of that and the mutilation and obviously it has consequences in my personal life in my sex life and in my life as a woman and so for me the after effects are with me for life
20130101_20130531_en_acru-0019 difficult for authorities to know the real extent of sexual mutilation in the west

20130101_20130531_en_acta-0004 of turkey
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0005 just a short time ago when he
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0006 linked zionism with crimes against humanity what reactions to
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0007 i
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0008 much
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0010 it raises the flames of hatred
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0011 totally unnecessarily
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0012 and
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0013 unfounded
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0014 relations with turkey over the last years have
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0015 not been great they been getting worse between turkey and israel is this part of the same process do you think
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0016 basically i do believe that the turkish people as the israeli people
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0017 peace and understanding
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0018 to
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0020 for
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0021 we
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0022 the entrance of turkey into
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0023 and on many occasions we were even instrumental and i personally got many thanks for those
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0024 and
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0025 today a united europe is not
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0027 middle east as it is is just a muslim
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0028 i think we live in a world of differences not in a world
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0029 democracy is not
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0030 the right to be equal but also the equal to be different
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0031 and
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0033 and what is the
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0034 of world is that a message about turkey that you will be
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0035 european leaders when you meet
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0036 no i think i shall discuss with european
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0037 relations or issues
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0038 are connecting europe with the middle east europe can play a
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0039 it it
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0040 and it can play
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0041 longer and
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0042 there was a rather worrying report that came out last week
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0043 by european union diplomats
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0044 the report was for
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0045 brussels
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0046 it said that
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0047 israeli building on occupied land
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0048 poses the most serious threat
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0049 to the creation of a palestinian state a two state solution
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0051 you might well have your work cut out to convince them that everything is going well here in israel
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0052 on a two state
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0053 solution
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0054 but we also more or less agreed on how it will
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0055 the two state solution
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0056 has a
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0057 to the issue of settlements
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0058 in the talks that took place in washington conducted
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0059 under presidency
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0060 of president clinton
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0061 we
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0062 three
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0063 for settlements or settlers
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0064 in the west bank
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0065 the palestinians would be compensated territorially accordingly
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0066 and am not taking this very pessimistic view that the present situation
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0067 stops the chance have the right solution
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0068 i think we
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0069 problems always richer than the solutions
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0070 but when you look at history finally
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0071 the problems died
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0072 and the solutions remained
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0073 the building of
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0074 specifically in the one region i is particularly upsetting for palestinians who say that this
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0075 particular piece of ground
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0076 be essential
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0077 in any two state solution
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0079 are to build
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0080 the announcement that the israeli
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0081 plan
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0082 and between planning building
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0083 there is a difference and a gap
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0084 and
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0085 negotiations
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0086 i think this again can be solved properly i agree there is a difference between planning and actually building but planning could still seen
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0087 a provocative measure
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0088 as a belligerent measure by saying
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0090 declaration of the announcement of planning
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0091 was a reaction the
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0092 the
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0094 so
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0095 is a little on the
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0096 side
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0097 but
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0098 looks upon
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0099 unilateral
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0100 united nations
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0101 a sort of provocation
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0102 we have to stop
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0103 stop
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0104 exchange of provocation and that is
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0105 where will it stop mister president
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0106 i
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0107 you should ask where will begin
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0109 the negotiations
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0110 and i feel there is a sort of
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0111 both sides
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0113 the opening is
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0114 to
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0115 for solutions how does it feel
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0116 after the oslo accords which you were so involved
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0117 that there are still so unresolved
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0118 so many unresolved but many of them
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0119 the same problems that existed twenty years ago
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0120 i wish it would be
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0121 but
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0122 to be patient without up the major goals
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0123 that if want
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0124 at
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0125 point
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0126 more difficult than you think it may take more time
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0127 is
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0129 so much time
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0131 convinced
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0132 that neither us nor the
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0133 a
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0134 solution realities are changing the time certainly in this particular region
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0136 your neighbours changing their climate
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0137 quite extensively how is that affecting
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0139 when you see happening in the middle east
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0140 compare it
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0141 to the past
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0142 or to the future
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0143 this is a result of the past we lost
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0144 but this is a call for the future
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0145 shall win
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0146 and i think all those changes arrived not because of the past but because the world
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0147 and scientific
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0148 i think today
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0149 technology
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0150 is more telling than strategy

20130101_20130531_en_acta-0152 who is

20130101_20130531_en_acta-0156 president obama asked me

20130101_20130531_en_acta-0168 belongs to young people
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0169 i think any leadership elected or unelected must give answers

20130101_20130531_en_acta-0171 food
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0172 to
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0173 freedom they give it up does that make it easier for the peace process now that the power in
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0174 the hands of the young and not in the hands of
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0175 old guard dictators ben ali and mubarak
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0177 you
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0178 it may be used an excuse but not as a reason
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0179 whatever happened in egypt tunisia
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0180 in yemen has nothing to do with
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0181 it is a result of
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0182 situation
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0183 so we pray for peace not only
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0184 between us and the
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0185 but for peace all over the place
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0187 related to president assad as a reasonable
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0188 studied in a british university who
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0189 something new
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0190 we discovered
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0191 that the same supposedly reasonable man
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0192 to build a nuclear
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0193 reactor
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0194 and i think everybody is relieved that least the nuclear option was stopped imagine that assad would have both nuclear bombs and chemical bombs my god
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0195 we cannot intervene because clearly will say that we are invading syria
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0196 the ones who have
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0197 and stop the bloodshed in syria
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0198 is an country
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0199 are more
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0200 of
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0201 the
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0202 should build a transitional government for
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0203 i think this should be supported by the united nations to stop immediately
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0204 the and the blood
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0205 the
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0206 respect much
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0207 must understand that problems they have to solve and not expect others
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0208 because if others
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0209 some
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0210 is intervention
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0211 it is time
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0212 for world
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0213 to take
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0214 syrian challenge in their hands
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0215 and solve it
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0216 and intelligently
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0217 the africans are trying to do something like in
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0218 you mentioned a nuclear capacity and of
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0219 your other
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0220 neighbour in the region
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0221 which is causing
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0222 a worry worldwide is iran
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0223 some worrying talk about a possible preemptive strike on iran would
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0224 condone would you back a military strike on iranian
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0225 facility
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0226 to put it in the
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0227 proportion
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0228 the policy
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0229 iran is first of
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0230 all other
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0231 economic sanctions
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0232 political pressure
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0233 even negotiations
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0234 i the one thing that was
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0235 is a call for human rights
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0236 call that was
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0237 in in
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0238 seventy-five at meeting between the soviet union of the time the united states and all of a sudden
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0239 on the table
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0240 a major issue as
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0241 the real victims right now the
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0242 story are the iranian people
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0243 they are suffering
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0244 enough
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0245 they cannot cure their sick people
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0246 million people suffer from cancer
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0247 because a small
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0248 religious
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0249 became
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0250 to establish
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0251 so the first call should be now
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0252 and even before elections june twenty-three
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0253 to
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0254 the elections be free
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0255 and not that they
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0256 elect again themselves
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0257 the nuclear programme is obviously a worry
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0258 sure
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0259 the
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0260 leaders of our time
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0261 headed by
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0262 a coalition with the
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0263 and
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0264 we cannot
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0265 a nuclear iran it danger for
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0266 the
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0268 for
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0271 the of obama all other options on
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0272 agencies
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0273 one is hezbollah in lebanon and the other is
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0274 in gaza
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0275 the result of the
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0276 of hezbollah is tragic
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0277 we hoped and i still hope
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0278 that lebanon could have become and may become the
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0279 the middle east
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0280 multicultural
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0281 people used to live in peace my
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0282 spoiled land
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0283 divided the people
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0284 the hezbollah tried
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0285 to
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0286 on twenty occasions
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0287 the last one was
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0288 and the
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0289 the five persons
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0290 israelis who
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0291 were killed by the hands of hezbollah
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0292 and a few ago it
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0293 in cyprus there are twenty cases
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0294 of acts of by
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0295 lebanon in many ways
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0296 i think
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0297 to save lebanon
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0298 we can manage hezbollah
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0300 is that true is that how you see now is there less communication between the house
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0301 the knesset
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0302 how relations with the states

20130101_20130531_en_acta-0310 not on the
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0311 that
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0312 so when they look at the
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0313 record of president obama i have highest
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0314 regard

20130101_20130531_en_acta-0321 of contention between us and the
20130101_20130531_en_acta-0322 states

20130101_20130531_en_actb-0012 chavez was re elected in two thousand with sixty percent of the vote but the economy would take a turn for the worse when crude oil prices plummeted after the september attacks on the us by islamist militants

20130101_20130531_en_actb-0025 this along with serial privatisations and oil revenue

20130101_20130531_en_acud-0011 that means
20130101_20130531_en_acud-0012 that you can transmit the power as we do it here at university
20130101_20130531_en_acud-0013 resonance
20130101_20130531_en_acud-0014 that means we have in the road surface and a coil in the car
20130101_20130531_en_acud-0015 they oscillate in sync and therefore get the energy across
20130101_20130531_en_acud-0016 scientists estimate that electric cars
20130101_20130531_en_acud-0017 half as much per kilometre as conventional petrol and diesel cars and obviously they are better the environment they are not only cleaner but also make no noise all
20130101_20130531_en_acud-0018 but to date the problem of range how far an car can go before the battery runs flat remains a disincentive to buying one but this wireless charging system could be the answer effortless and it cuts out the inconvenience of waiting several hours for your battery to recharge

20130101_20130531_en_acug-0018 when your competitor goes down you recognize that he was an extraordinary man
20130101_20130531_en_acug-0019 for us it means that the election campaign the constitution now requires must be fair
20130101_20130531_en_acug-0020 the opposition
20130101_20130531_en_acug-0021 and other candidates vying for the presidency
20130101_20130531_en_acug-0022 should be able to compete in this campaign on an even basis which means that

20130101_20130531_en_acug-0024 on the media
20130101_20130531_en_acug-0025 and that the governing party does not monopolise

20130101_20130531_en_acug-0028 is what the united states will ask for
20130101_20130531_en_acug-0030 the country today is going through a very serious economic crisis
20130101_20130531_en_acug-0031 there are shortages of everything

20130101_20130531_en_acug-0044 that run out

20130101_20130531_en_acug-0048 a populist leader needs
20130101_20130531_en_acug-0049 unifying
20130101_20130531_en_acug-0050 around which his followers can gather
20130101_20130531_en_acug-0051 anti imperialism anti americanism was convenient to them
20130101_20130531_en_acug-0052 the successor will
20130101_20130531_en_acug-0053 that
20130101_20130531_en_acug-0054 is not certain
20130101_20130531_en_acug-0055 principally because

20130101_20130531_en_acug-0063 we can deal with a amount of rhetoric but one time got to be realistic and i would argue that post chavez
20130101_20130531_en_acug-0064 dose of realism would do well for venezuela

20130101_20130531_en_acvf-0040 i would make about the us is that we that market drop to less than ten million units three or four ago and of course the market is coming back very strong
20130101_20130531_en_acvf-0041 the health of the united states market and growth
20130101_20130531_en_acvf-0042 is built on the fact that we continue to introduce

20130101_20130531_en_acvg-0026 last november benedict elevated six non european priests to the rank of cardinal following pressure from critics observers say this raises chances of an outsider ascending the throne
20130101_20130531_en_acvg-0028 was elected
20130101_20130531_en_acvg-0029 in what you think about the rebellious approach that a lot of the cardinals are in congregations is their influence significant in this unexpected papal
20130101_20130531_en_acvg-0031 they want to find an agreement

20130101_20130531_en_acvg-0035 only after these important inquiries have been answered
20130101_20130531_en_acvg-0039 and the intellect of benedict
20130101_20130531_en_acvg-0040 a pope who knows how to mix with

20130101_20130531_en_acvg-0044 it was because old europe has a gulf which must be bridged
20130101_20130531_en_acvg-0045 a distance between where one is and where one wants to be
20130101_20130531_en_acvg-0046 i believe your average church goer will see things this way

20130101_20130531_en_acwq-0084 is easy to answer
20130101_20130531_en_acwr-0001 in many the world is a better place for women than it was a century
20130101_20130531_en_acwr-0004 women are still too often the victims of violence and oppression

20130101_20130531_en_acwr-0034 the

20130101_20130531_en_acwr-0037 arranged marriages are common in this part of the world
20130101_20130531_en_acwr-0038 women here have seen improvements
20130101_20130531_en_acwr-0039 but even now many of them face discrimination it can be hugely difficult for women to access even secondary education

20130101_20130531_en_acwr-0069 four
20130101_20130531_en_acws-0002 to
20130101_20130531_en_acws-0003 power song
20130101_20130531_en_acws-0004 this who
20130101_20130531_en_acws-0005 to go after guy and i really admire that and
20130101_20130531_en_acws-0007 sharing my with people so
20130101_20130531_en_acws-0008 the album itself has bunch of different styles to it
20130101_20130531_en_acws-0012 i think it basically keeps the character throughout because
20130101_20130531_en_acws-0013 part of making
20130101_20130531_en_acwt-0001 will the hugo chavez cult die out now that the charismatic president is dead
20130101_20130531_en_acwt-0002 his propelled venezuela into a period of uncertainty before the new elections which should be held within thirty days so does this signal the end of an era not only for venezuela but for the whole of south america
20130101_20130531_en_acwt-0005 against opposition leader henrique
20130101_20130531_en_acwt-0006 beaten chavez at the presidential elections in october two thousand twelve
20130101_20130531_en_acwt-0007 the late president a mixed
20130101_20130531_en_acwt-0008 oil reserves said to be the largest in the world allowed him to launch social programmes to build new housing to tackle illiteracy and to reduce poverty very significantly but on the other hand he leaves behind a disorganised economy a decapitated national oil company and inflation which looks set to top twenty-nine percent this year a big question for venezuela will be finding out who is to succeed chavez and whether that person will continue along his revolutionary path of will try a different one one thing is sure the influence of hugo chavez will shape venezuelan politics and society for many years to come
20130101_20130531_en_acwt-0010 to talk about the the country after the death of
20130101_20130531_en_acwt-0011 first question is despite a debatable economic balance sheet
20130101_20130531_en_acwt-0012 elections he won thirteen out of fourteen of he was re three times at the end of his life the day he died his popularity was enormous nearly seventy percent what explains this magic
20130101_20130531_en_acwt-0013 yes he was a unique case history and we need to reflect on that
20130101_20130531_en_acwt-0014 but
20130101_20130531_en_acwt-0015 in history are numerous cases of political leaders who have created not only political links but also emotional and loving links with the population
20130101_20130531_en_acwt-0016 things like this happen with characters with particular personalities
20130101_20130531_en_acwt-0017 gift for empathy and even extravagance
20130101_20130531_en_acwt-0019 i mean he divided the country into two halves one half loved him with devotion even and the other half
20130101_20130531_en_acwt-0021 succeeded making the end of poverty a national project
20130101_20130531_en_acwt-0022 but his greatest failure well after fourteen years we still have that poverty he succeeded in reducing critical poverty which around half the population
20130101_20130531_en_acwt-0023 but general poverty is still daily life for sixty percent
20130101_20130531_en_acwt-0024 cult of outlived the man himself and the cult of castro is still alive in cuba even though castro has retired
20130101_20130531_en_acwt-0025 can the chavez cult outlive chavez
20130101_20130531_en_acwt-0026 was much more popular than chavez
20130101_20130531_en_acwt-0027 but also
20130101_20130531_en_acwt-0028 constructed a political movement a doctrine and way of thinking politically and ideologically
20130101_20130531_en_acwt-0029 in contrast with chavez there was only chavez
20130101_20130531_en_acwt-0030 and surrounding him is only mediocrity and
20130101_20130531_en_acwt-0033 but also he constructed a political party without a single new thought
20130101_20130531_en_acwt-0034 the death of leaves an empty space in
20130101_20130531_en_acwt-0035 correa
20130101_20130531_en_acwt-0037 felt that venezuela was too small for him because he felt he the heir
20130101_20130531_en_acwt-0038 he felt he to act
20130101_20130531_en_acwt-0039 did at the level of the entire continent
20130101_20130531_en_acwu-0001 it sixty years since tunisia granted women of the most reaching rights in the arab world
20130101_20130531_en_acwu-0003 in fifty tunisia abolished polygamy scrapped
20130101_20130531_en_acwu-0004 and allowed abortion and divorce but since the arrival of the islamist party
20130101_20130531_en_acwu-0007 during the electoral campaign they all said

20130101_20130531_en_aczk-0002 but what can be done to prevent such
20130101_20130531_en_aczk-0003 the
20130101_20130531_en_aczk-0005 the underground sensors developed within a european union research project transmit measurements to data centres in several countries
20130101_20130531_en_aczk-0006 boston on the east coast england is one of the main test sites for the new technology
20130101_20130531_en_aczk-0007 river rises dramatically with the sea tides putting local citizens at risk
20130101_20130531_en_aczk-0009 involved in the study have designed several types of sensors reliable and affordable enough to be put in damp embankments
20130101_20130531_en_aczk-0010 a sensor a measuring device that has electronic components inside a stainless container it has tiny opening through which water can enter
20130101_20130531_en_aczk-0011 device measures the amount of water in the dam and many other parameters such as the underground temperature and the movement of the sensors inside the dam
20130101_20130531_en_aczk-0012 these indications can be followed in real time using any
20130101_20130531_en_aczk-0013 enabled device
20130101_20130531_en_aczk-0014 a touch screen panel installed in a boston
20130101_20130531_en_aczk-0015 allows the public to see how the system works
20130101_20130531_en_aczk-0016 if the artificial intelligence anticipates a breach it sends a warning to the
20130101_20130531_en_aczk-0017 services that may

20130101_20130531_en_aczk-0019 currently we use a visual walkover it means
20130101_20130531_en_aczk-0020 year we people viewing asset from visual point this technology allows us to actually understand how the bank is performing so it at
20130101_20130531_en_aczk-0022 real time happening
20130101_20130531_en_aczk-0023 the software calculates how fast the site will be flooded if the dam fails and even suggests the ways to move citizens into safer areas
20130101_20130531_en_aczk-0024 system will allow to show you the outline of the flood mapping we can then run a life safety
20130101_20130531_en_aczk-0025 which will show the evacuation process that people can take
20130101_20130531_en_aczk-0026 this can be used by emergency planners for them to be able to test various scenarios of
20130101_20130531_en_aczk-0027 to find the best evacuation procedure in the event of the failure
20130101_20130531_en_aczk-0028 if proved reliable this system could be deployed in many urban

20130101_20130531_en_aczl-0036 we also have to have a game and then they ask somebody could you make a game
20130101_20130531_en_aczl-0037 normally not be a good game because

20130101_20130531_en_aczm-0013 is said to be favoured by a group led by
20130101_20130531_en_aczm-0015 scandal and reports of infighting
20130101_20130531_en_aczm-0016 but previous conclaves have produced surprises and several other names also emerged as potential popes
20130101_20130531_en_aczm-0018 the new man will need many attributes is unlikely to please everyone
20130101_20130531_en_aczm-0019 so what are the different scenarios the conclave
20130101_20130531_en_aczm-0020 the vatican
20130101_20130531_en_aczm-0021 the
20130101_20130531_en_aczm-0022 are the
20130101_20130531_en_aczm-0023 tendencies that could determine the choice
20130101_20130531_en_aczm-0024 the next conclave
20130101_20130531_en_aczm-0026 scherer the archbishop of sao paolo brazil is also the
20130101_20130531_en_aczm-0028 during the first votes for these names there could be a kind of confrontation between members of the
20130101_20130531_en_aczm-0029 and the cardinals outside of the
20130101_20130531_en_aczm-0031 are there any favourites in this conclave
20130101_20130531_en_aczm-0032 the moment there is a leaning towards the first ever non european pope
20130101_20130531_en_aczm-0033 and the financial scandals within vatican have had a very harmful effect on the
20130101_20130531_en_aczm-0034 and the italian cardinals
20130101_20130531_en_aczm-0035 this has weakened the possibility of a return an italian pope after two foreign pontificates
20130101_20130531_en_aczm-0036 so for now the strongest candidate with the support of
20130101_20130531_en_aczm-0037 the secretary of state seems to be the brazilian cardinal scherer who combines his pastoral activity of bishop in sao
20130101_20130531_en_aczm-0039 in february twelve benedict
20130101_20130531_en_aczm-0040 twenty-two cardinals most of them italians in november he chose six non european cardinals almost as a way of balancing the conclave do you think the next pontificate will continue in the same way
20130101_20130531_en_aczm-0042 the next pope will inherit from benedict the
20130101_20130531_en_aczm-0043 management of the fight against sexual abuse within the church and the
20130101_20130531_en_aczm-0045 is the pope who called for the resignation of about eighty bishops for having prevented the sexual abuse of priests and had re established in the vatican the authority to disclose financial information to bring to light and watch over the holy finances
20130101_20130531_en_aczm-0047 that those who are too of a favourite at the beginning risk
20130101_20130531_en_aczm-0048 at the time of the vote is there any in that
20130101_20130531_en_aczm-0050 the general congregations which characterised this pre conclave phase have shown that the cardinals especially those from the southern
20130101_20130531_en_aczm-0051 want to be protagonists in a demand for clarification
20130101_20130531_en_aczm-0052 the roman curia to be reformed in a way benedict
20130101_20130531_en_aczm-0054 it will be a significant point if the next pope is not only
20130101_20130531_en_aczm-0055 because he was named by ratzinger but also because of his will to continue the cleaning up
20130101_20130531_en_aczm-0056 started by benedict
20130101_20130531_en_aczm-0057 and to follow fight against the scandals within the church
20130101_20130531_en_aczm-0058 so all those cardinals who been caught up in the
20130101_20130531_en_aczm-0059 scandal will be out of the running
20130101_20130531_en_aczm-0060 apparently a sort of tsunami of non european candidates will fall upon the roman and this could take the pontificate far away from rome
20130101_20130531_en_aczm-0061 it
20130101_20130531_en_aczn-0001 spent a month in after was knocked off

20130101_20130531_en_aczp-0010 the threat of bread and water is necessary many are speculating this will be a short conclave
20130101_20130531_en_aczp-0011 we will have a pope by the end the week this
20130101_20130531_en_aczp-0012 and they are well prepared they know what they have to do
20130101_20130531_en_aczp-0013 the cardinals may talk about key issues that have affected the church such as the
20130101_20130531_en_aczp-0014 scandal as well as the attributes of any new
20130101_20130531_en_aczp-0015 i think
20130101_20130531_en_aczp-0016 more variety of younger people

20130101_20130531_en_adcu-0002 the material inside booms is both ecologically friendly and very efficient because it is made of paper mill sludge
20130101_20130531_en_adcu-0003 this organic compound is a waste product produced recycling paper so there is plenty of it around
20130101_20130531_en_adcu-0004 every year the european union produces more than six million tons of paper mill sludge

20130101_20130531_en_adcu-0008 it can absorb around four its own weight which about the same as other existing absorbents but what makes it different is that much cheaper than the alternatives and not only useful for mopping up spills on water it could also be useful in petrol stations
20130101_20130531_en_adcu-0009 use it to clean up spills of all kinds of fluids with different chemical properties we can use at petrol stations and anywhere else where spills are likely
20130101_20130531_en_adcu-0010 is impressively efficient and in comparison with other products we can use smaller quantities to achieve the same effect

20130101_20130531_en_addd-0020 can the oldest institution in the world achieve growth without reform

20130101_20130531_en_addg-0006 how should we interpret this election is francis first going to be a pope for the poor comes the continent with most catholic believers and many social problems
20130101_20130531_en_addg-0008 this has lots of moral implications think of over population birth control all will be debated again
20130101_20130531_en_addg-0010 scandal
20130101_20130531_en_addg-0011 indeed the new pope is the only one with access to the secret report written by the three cardinals for his predecessor pope ratzinger he will than realize who is not reliable in the curia and what has happened
20130101_20130531_en_addg-0012 the most important mission is the reform of the curia a clear conception how the church should be led
20130101_20130531_en_addg-0013 will be important to the right secretary of state not to just confirm the leaders of the ministries but to bring in competent people so as to really reform the church
20130101_20130531_en_addg-0014 we need nothing more urgently than a reform of roman court which become centre of the church which must really functions and not obstruct

20130101_20130531_en_addg-0017 but it must not allow
20130101_20130531_en_addg-0018 behaviour nor point the moral finger
20130101_20130531_en_addg-0020 show comprehension and also stand together with other christian churches and world religions
20130101_20130531_en_addg-0021 it has to work for peace in the world
20130101_20130531_en_addg-0022 there are gigantic tasks
20130101_20130531_en_addg-0023 and i really hope this pope will do more for the renewal the church more christian churches
20130101_20130531_en_addg-0024 more for peace and well being in the world than his two predecessors

20130101_20130531_en_adeg-0007 my main goals are to
20130101_20130531_en_adeg-0008 make sure there is stability in the

20130101_20130531_en_adei-0001 iran has continued to make headlines in recent weeks partly because yet another round futile international negotiations over its nuclear programme and partly because of a new

20130101_20130531_en_adei-0014 we are not
20130101_20130531_en_adei-0015 but we think that our record on human rights definitely
20130101_20130531_en_adei-0016 is not worse than the other countries who are really
20130101_20130531_en_adei-0017 on us a good number of
20130101_20130531_en_adei-0018 eu members
20130101_20130531_en_adei-0019 this report is based on one hundred sixty-nine

20130101_20130531_en_adei-0027 there must be an element or many elements of truth in it
20130101_20130531_en_adei-0028 the issue of credibility in this report
20130101_20130531_en_adei-0029 is serious
20130101_20130531_en_adei-0030 we agree that some of our laws
20130101_20130531_en_adei-0031 modification
20130101_20130531_en_adei-0032 we support even against western criticism
20130101_20130531_en_adei-0033 the number of
20130101_20130531_en_adei-0034 iran is
20130101_20130531_en_adei-0035 we should change the law there are a number of
20130101_20130531_en_adei-0036 crimes
20130101_20130531_en_adei-0037 connected to

20130101_20130531_en_adei-0041 so this
20130101_20130531_en_adei-0042 and a lot of people the
20130101_20130531_en_adei-0043 agree with me
20130101_20130531_en_adei-0045 that if i express an opinion if i am
20130101_20130531_en_adei-0047 on that because this is
20130101_20130531_en_adei-0048 the real
20130101_20130531_en_adei-0049 iran is ahead of all countries in the middle east the
20130101_20130531_en_adei-0050 extent that the

20130101_20130531_en_adei-0052 the use of is limited because you
20130101_20130531_en_adei-0053 an issue globally there are issues that
20130101_20130531_en_adei-0054 considered
20130101_20130531_en_adei-0055 to the

20130101_20130531_en_adei-0058 of children
20130101_20130531_en_adei-0059 things like that
20130101_20130531_en_adei-0060 to be followed up or filtered criticising the ruling elite
20130101_20130531_en_adei-0061 should not be filtered what about torture in prisons
20130101_20130531_en_adei-0062 well torture in prison is a disease
20130101_20130531_en_adei-0063 crime
20130101_20130531_en_adei-0064 but compare us with united states yes but you cannot justify wrong in iran by comparing it with wrong doing elsewhere like
20130101_20130531_en_adei-0065 there is no absolute good according to
20130101_20130531_en_adei-0066 is major
20130101_20130531_en_adei-0067 according islam and sharia torture may receive penalty what about the practice
20130101_20130531_en_adei-0068 when to practice
20130101_20130531_en_adei-0069 you recently we totally changed the legal supervision of the police
20130101_20130531_en_adei-0070 temporary

20130101_20130531_en_adha-0001 the surprise decision by eurozone leaders part fund a bailout of cyprus by taxing bank deposits sent shockwaves through financial markets shares as investors sold to transfer cash into so called safe haven assets such as gold and government bonds frankfurt trader warned of fear contagion to places like spain and italy

20130101_20130531_en_adhb-0002 daniel dubois is an farmer who farms around two hundred cattle for milk and in southern belgium is
20130101_20130531_en_adhb-0003 farmer fighting for a better distribution of eu cash
20130101_20130531_en_adhb-0004 the problem is not agriculture whatever the size the problem is subsidies are distributed around farmers and not necessarily the farmers themselves
20130101_20130531_en_adhb-0005 smaller producers want subsidies to be capped at a maximum of one hundred euros in direct assistance
20130101_20130531_en_adhb-0007 people are unsure what is actually given to the industry i think the cap must be transparent other industries other ways to get money the agricultural subsidies should go to that produce

20130101_20130531_en_adhc-0003 the commission to comment further at this point time
20130101_20130531_en_adhc-0004 to say
20130101_20130531_en_adhc-0005 that we fully support

20130101_20130531_en_adhc-0009 there was no real choice
20130101_20130531_en_adhc-0010 the total rescue would have to amount to seventeen billion
20130101_20130531_en_adhc-0012 that would have endangered fiscal sustainability in cyprus
20130101_20130531_en_adhc-0013 if cyprus rejects

20130101_20130531_en_adhc-0019 enormous financial chaos in cyprus
20130101_20130531_en_adhc-0020 that could lead

20130101_20130531_en_adhd-0004 after being diagnosed with tuberculosis i had two options first a long stay in a hospital room where nobody could visit me without wearing a mask
20130101_20130531_en_adhd-0005 staying secluded at home and coming here to the hospital every day for treatment a daily injection and twenty-two pills that i also had to take daily in the presence of a nurse
20130101_20130531_en_adhd-0006 i opted for this second option
20130101_20130531_en_adhd-0007 i had to go outside to the bakery or other places i always had to wear

20130101_20130531_en_adhd-0011 pharmaceutical lab near the hospital scientists from a european union research project are trying find answers to the complex and often dramatic challenges by
20130101_20130531_en_adhd-0012 the disease
20130101_20130531_en_adhd-0014 unlike the only existing one hundred year old tuberculosis vaccine this is a live vaccine based on a weakened version of the bacterium that causes the disease
20130101_20130531_en_adhd-0015 researchers hope this will make the vaccine safer and more effective

20130101_20130531_en_adhd-0021 in lausanne switzerland the first
20130101_20130531_en_adhd-0022 clinical trials using real volunteers have begun
20130101_20130531_en_adhd-0023 researchers
20130101_20130531_en_adhd-0025 provided that it successfully passes three clinical trials needed for scientific validation researchers hope that industrial production of the new vaccine could start in around ten years
20130101_20130531_en_adhe-0002 if the project proves successful it mean that houses and offices built in the future will contribute to general energy supplies
20130101_20130531_en_adhe-0004 are using screen presses and roller coating techniques to cover building materials with the specially designed solar paints
20130101_20130531_en_adhe-0005 chemical compounds are added layers to sheets of glass plastic and steel which then absorb the power of the sun
20130101_20130531_en_adhe-0006 chemical compounds the difference
20130101_20130531_en_adhe-0007 in its simplest form we can use

20130101_20130531_en_adhe-0009 the of thing you pencil you can get a pencil to conduct electricity
20130101_20130531_en_adhe-0010 we might be putting other things such as silvers
20130101_20130531_en_adhe-0011 we can make an ink which is silver
20130101_20130531_en_adhe-0012 by cladding buildings in these paints researchers

20130101_20130531_en_adhe-0014 only do they think they will create thousands of new jobs in the sector but that these paints will transform the way we see our cities as everyday buildings schools supermarkets churches all become stations in their right

20130101_20130531_en_adhf-0010 just like jesus on the cross one arm to the left another the
20130101_20130531_en_adhf-0011 that demands an enormous amount of self confidence and faith
20130101_20130531_en_adhf-0012 taking the name of francis is certainly no accident
20130101_20130531_en_adhf-0014 he to revive an ecclesiastical figure from the thirteen th century who was also called francis
20130101_20130531_en_adhf-0016 i want to make it solid like the ancient francis did
20130101_20130531_en_adhf-0017 difficult to understand what the pope signifies for christians for believers but what does he represent for those without

20130101_20130531_en_adhf-0019 we wonder why this audience
20130101_20130531_en_adhf-0020 of course we could think we were in some sort of technical
20130101_20130531_en_adhf-0021 and everything is happening television
20130101_20130531_en_adhf-0022 we saw so much because of all technical resources available
20130101_20130531_en_adhf-0023 but i our modern society is very demanding
20130101_20130531_en_adhf-0031 a
20130101_20130531_en_adhf-0032 to
20130101_20130531_en_adhf-0033 is a need for faith natural for men and women
20130101_20130531_en_adhf-0035 in any case homo sapiens is groomed from a young age invest emotionally in an external figure which is the father
20130101_20130531_en_adhf-0037 about recognition father recognises me
20130101_20130531_en_adhf-0038 i recognise
20130101_20130531_en_adhf-0039 this has existed in all people since the dawn of time and oral tradition has preserved it
20130101_20130531_en_adhf-0041 and there exists a root
20130101_20130531_en_adhf-0042 a root called
20130101_20130531_en_adhf-0043 which gave birth to credo which is about faith
20130101_20130531_en_adhf-0045 again another investment

20130101_20130531_en_adhg-0004 the
20130101_20130531_en_adhg-0005 celebrated worldwide as one the great masters of improvisation the key principle of
20130101_20130531_en_adhg-0006 we have
20130101_20130531_en_adhg-0007 this concert in way but sang in another my vision of this performance has been changed i was influenced by what i saw by the sound of our voices in this particular moment and by the feelings of my soul
20130101_20130531_en_adhg-0009 a student of the tar for more than thirty years the
20130101_20130531_en_adhg-0010 is the music of our existence
20130101_20130531_en_adhg-0011 we have a singing universe the scientists have misnamed it completely called the big bang not
20130101_20130531_en_adhg-0012 big note
20130101_20130531_en_adhg-0014 some researchers argue that the structure of this vocal art is linked to the geometrical forms and
20130101_20130531_en_adhg-0016 abstract at their sides with often violently bright spots marking
20130101_20130531_en_adhg-0019 the
20130101_20130531_en_adhg-0020 slots in the festival programme have been given to a new
20130101_20130531_en_adhg-0021 music unique hybrid of the two kings of improvisation
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0001 anxious residents of cyprus with money in the bank have been unable to take it out cash dispensers have dried up and bank doors are locked the accounts of individuals have directly linked to a european bailout plan for cypriots
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0002 the government says it was left with no choice and that the alternative was a losing proposition now small account holders as well as large are dreading the pinch where it hurts most their wallets as currently stand cyprus is waiting for ten billion euros in aid from the eu and the international monetary fund one of conditions is accounts than hundred euros be taxed at a rate of six
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0003 percent and above that at a rate of nine nine percent the island asked for seventeen billion euros which was cut back
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0004 the bank account measure is aimed at grabbing up five eight billion euros
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0005 corporations will also be expected lighten their wallets
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0006 from on are joined by joao rodrigues a professor at the institute of european studies in brussels and an advisor to a number of european institutions
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0007 for the first time in a bailout bank depositors are having contribute has the european union broken a taboo
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0009 up to hundred
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0010 that clear principle set after the two thousand eight financial crisis in order to prevent contagion the collapse of lehman brothers
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0011 so in my opinion we have to respect that principle
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0012 is risk of contagion in the euro zone
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0013 the risk of contagion is limited because not talking about a big event but anyway the authorities must clearly state the principle that was
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0014 that the protection small investors in europe will be respected
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0017 i think cyprus really needed this european loan to stop it slipping and the crisis getting
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0018 but said that the loan must be provided under conditions that make cyprus responsible as well there has to be an effort by the country
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0020 is going to include
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0021 who are outside cyprus
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0022 are we going to involve the big investors who are not from the european union
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0024 exactly you mention russian assets maybe fifteen to twenty billion euros perhaps dirty money
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0025 is this a way for the eurozone to clean up the cypriot banking system
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0026 yes i think this bailout loan process in cyprus should be used to make the cypriot banks more
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0028 the thing that must be clarified
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0029 the
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0030 financial markets fell as a result of this
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0031 is there a risk of uncertainty returning to the markets after they have been stable for several weeks
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0032 yes i think that could be a
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0034 and therefore in my opinion a very clear message has to be sent as soon as possible by the european institutions starting with the european central bank
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0001 this
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0002 unfair commercial practices
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0003 them are obvious
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0004 such as miracle cures for example others are hidden in places expect to find them in loans or between the lines of too good to be true promotions we
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0005 when i bought my computer nobody told that all consumer goods bought in europe have an automatic two year guarantee
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0006 salesman said my computer only had a one year guarantee
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0007 the directive return up to two years after purchase instead client a so called extended warranty that fact overlapped the free statutory two year warranty
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0008 a
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0009 as
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0010 apple is
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0014 role in fighting unfair commercial practices
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0015 they receive the complaints and pass them on to the italian antitrust authority
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0017 apple was to update the information given on its website
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0019 and they were also forced to give their salespeople new guidelines
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0020 of
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0021 according the european directive there are two main categories of unfair commercial practices aggressive and misleading the latter be it through action omission pushes the average to take decisions he would not have taken misleading advertising is one example
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0022 a journalist specialised in consumer protection
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0023 this a typical example of misleading advertising because it includes unconfirmed
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0024 data that
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0025 consumers
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0027 it says that
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0028 cannot you with the daily amount of calcium
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0031 and
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0034 no one really talks about
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0036 nine out of ten large companies have been fined at least once
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0038 fines are included their budgets
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0039 misleading advertising only a drop in the ocean of unfair practices door to door selling for example can easily turn into aggressive practice
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0040 the eu has drawn up a black list of
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0041 regarded as unfair and thus banned
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0042 the directive adopted in two thousand five replaced national legislation
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0043 making sure it is enforced however is another kettle of fish
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0044 member states deplore a lack of resources the complexity of internal procedures and the absence of sanctions

20130101_20130531_en_adim-0001 there is a growing question mark a commonly prescribed type of drug to lower
20130101_20130531_en_adim-0002 some scientists and doctors believe statins are overused but the latest round of debate in france goes even further
20130101_20130531_en_adim-0003 professors bernard
20130101_20130531_en_adim-0004 and philippe
20130101_20130531_en_adim-0005 have published a guidebook for thousands of drugs and believe statins are useless

20130101_20130531_en_adim-0008 he has an unhealthy diet he smokes and does not exercise combining all the major factors
20130101_20130531_en_adim-0009 his specialist is
20130101_20130531_en_adim-0010 concerned about his high level of
20130101_20130531_en_adim-0013 despite the controversy many doctors still believe they prevent high cholesterol levels and cardio vascular problems
20130101_20130531_en_adim-0014 in coronary patients that is people who had a heart attack or angina statins not only reduce the risk of having a recurrence quite
20130101_20130531_en_adim-0015 they lower the risk of death or more accurately put the risk of death further away raise the life expectancy of these patients in a quite significant manner
20130101_20130531_en_adim-0016 statins are among the most prescribed drugs in the world in france they used by at least four million people

20130101_20130531_en_adim-0018 billion euros a year
20130101_20130531_en_adim-0020 these drugs have been extremely well scrutinized for side effects and anyway there are not many drugs that can reduce mortality by ten percent like statins
20130101_20130531_en_adim-0021 the
20130101_20130531_en_adim-0022 not everyone is such a fan

20130101_20130531_en_adim-0025 he took statins for ten years it was a decade of painful side effects professional problems and a family crisis
20130101_20130531_en_adim-0026 now he has ditched the statins and he is back on top again
20130101_20130531_en_adim-0027 mainly i felt fatigue when i came home i was drained i had no energy nothing
20130101_20130531_en_adim-0028 and when i say i had no motivation i none whatsoever
20130101_20130531_en_adim-0029 in the morning when i was back in the office i hundred percent with the clients but i stopped the statins even before i started exercise again i felt much better ten times better
20130101_20130531_en_adim-0031 one leading cardiologist has changed his mind about statins
20130101_20130531_en_adim-0032 michel de
20130101_20130531_en_adim-0033 now believes they serve no purpose in lowering
20130101_20130531_en_adim-0034 to prevent cardiac problems indeed he even thinks they are dangerous
20130101_20130531_en_adim-0035 come to the inevitable conclusion in the end that these drugs unnecessary and toxic
20130101_20130531_en_adim-0036 must be removed from the market and the health service must stop paying for them
20130101_20130531_en_adim-0037 professors and have already said if you really want to protect yourself from heart disease and stroke you should turn to something other than anti cholesterol drugs

20130101_20130531_en_adiq-0006 for as long as it is necessary we will ask france for help and assistance but want to rebuild rapidly the operational capacity of the malian in such a way that we need to have foreign troops in our country for too long
20130101_20130531_en_adiq-0007 correspondent it remains to be seen whether the timetable for french withdrawal is realistic for in spite of some reassuring announcements notably those about help for democracy and development schedule could clash with the reality on the ground

20130101_20130531_en_adjt-0001 you trust with your money
20130101_20130531_en_adjt-0002 before weekend you may have grudgingly said the banks
20130101_20130531_en_adjt-0003 a nightmarish precedent has been set
20130101_20130531_en_adjt-0004 in times of trouble
20130101_20130531_en_adjt-0005 your money is
20130101_20130531_en_adjt-0007 but there has been a shattering breach of trust
20130101_20130531_en_adjt-0009 the
20130101_20130531_en_adjt-0010 deposit guarantee scheme in the eu and a
20130101_20130531_en_adjt-0011 not to respect that deposit scheme is just a terrible decision
20130101_20130531_en_adjt-0012 and the reason why terrible
20130101_20130531_en_adjt-0014 the banking sector in europe now has twice as much capital
20130101_20130531_en_adjt-0015 had before the crisis so i think by now it is more robust but will grow more going forward
20130101_20130531_en_adjt-0016 savers can be absolutely certain that they will
20130101_20130531_en_adjt-0017 have their money when they approach the bank and
20130101_20130531_en_adjt-0018 the and they have to their best to restore this trust
20130101_20130531_en_adjt-0019 it is a relationship between two sides and trust is a necessary part of that
20130101_20130531_en_adjt-0020 so i think going to be a slow process
20130101_20130531_en_adjt-0021 we just have to work at cyprus is deep in debt its banks remain closed savers have been handed a reprieve but axe fall

20130101_20130531_en_adju-0005 care organisations
20130101_20130531_en_adju-0006 one of the biggest problems when getting older
20130101_20130531_en_adju-0007 and for that we wanted to have a solution that is mobile not attached to the because then very often not accepted and not
20130101_20130531_en_adju-0008 the
20130101_20130531_en_adju-0009 sure that corridors are wide enough just pushing a chair the side
20130101_20130531_en_adju-0010 in sense the hobbit is an extension of the mutual care concept in automation
20130101_20130531_en_adju-0011 the building of a relationship between a human and a robot whereby both take care of each
20130101_20130531_en_adju-0012 this all sounds perfectly harmonious but given the target group it is not project without its
20130101_20130531_en_adju-0013 challenge is to make
20130101_20130531_en_adju-0014 use so easy
20130101_20130531_en_adju-0015 that an older person can
20130101_20130531_en_adju-0016 naturally intuitively use it
20130101_20130531_en_adju-0017 one of the technical challenges
20130101_20130531_en_adju-0018 the second challenge is to bring all the pieces together into one system
20130101_20130531_en_adju-0019 you need the user interface which is now speech audio
20130101_20130531_en_adju-0020 perhaps the ultimate challenge for the developers however will be how to make the early prototypes affordable for elderly people in their
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0003 possible solutions to the crisis pushed europe into recession
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0004 the treaty on stability coordination and governance the budgetary pact signed in
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0005 twelve forces eurozone countries to put balancing their budget their constitutions making it illegal not to you have been critical of the pact was there really nothing good about
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0006 it
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0007 if you like this budgetary pact refers to the lack of a political europe
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0008 and it raises the question of what is happening with this integration process where democracy is being reduced within each member state without increasing democracy at the federal level
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0010 a real basic problem
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0011 but
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0012 behind
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0013 budget issue there is the of respecting the economic rules
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0014 in the past
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0015 all they about was the currency
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0016 now all they care about is budget discipline
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0017 europeans are very dogmatic
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0018 very much focused just on that
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0019 and so they try to explain everything by that
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0020 before the creation of the single european currency
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0021 was the factor after the of the single european currency balanced budgets and public debt are the factors
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0022 exactly you said that national debts are sovereign but the euro is a currency without a country without a political union is the banking union been agreed is enough
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0023 yes and no
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0025 the problem is that the european countries are running up debt in a currency over which they have no control
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0026 that means they get into debt in a currency
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0027 and so
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0028 they go bankrupt
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0029 a country borrows in a currency it controls it can never become insolvent
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0030 if emerging countries bankrupt because their debts are in a foreign currency
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0031 that means there is a defect in the structure that opens it up to speculation
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0032 what can done to reduce or prevent this speculation over whether a state is solvent
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0034 when the exchange for individual currencies disappeared it was no longer possible to speculate in those european currencies
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0035 now we have to create single equity or security for debt that way it would not be possible for investors to speculate on european sovereign debt
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0038 that means there is only european debt
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0041 of when
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0042 was elected president of france you said you agreed with much of his economic programme you still hold view
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0044 but there were no renegotiations
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0045 and
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0050 and i think might actually be quite effective in providing an example to other
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0051 but europe is not in a good position to learn the lesson
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0052 because
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0053 europe has competitive tax system so if a european country began to to do the same as switzerland
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0054 some of its
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0055 might go off and live
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0056 in places with better tax regime for them
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0058 this is a question that i find very problematic
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0059 because i see people suffering everywhere
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0060 in italy
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0061 obviously spain
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0062 france
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0063 germany
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0064 where poverty has increased considerable
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0065 britain and people are committing suicide which is not a normal thing
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0066 so they want change
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0067 and
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0068 long
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0069 start thinking there is no possibility of change
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0070 europe has to change
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0071 the people themselves might give on the european project
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0074 we set out to create a single people
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0075 and we will have been deflected from that by a dogmatic approach
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0001 the soul searching in brussels is underway after cyprus
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0002 the conditions of eu assistance

20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0007 and preferences
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0008 the commission felt a duty to support it
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0009 since the alternatives
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0010 put forward
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0011 more risky
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0012 and less supportive
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0013 economy
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0014 germany in an election year and is showing signs of bailout fatigue
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0015 and blames cyprus for a mess of its own making
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0016 the room for manoeuvre from the side of
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0017 partners is extremely
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0018 i cannot imagine
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0019 the german
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0020 simply
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0021 the parliament does not want to tax rich russian depositors so now the german tax
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0022 the visit of cypriot finance minister michael sarris to moscow clearly irritated european president martin
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0023 we need a european
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0024 within the european union within the eurozone i think we should not
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0025 the outside the is unable to solve problems
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0026 structures

20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0029 next for cyprus is there a plan b
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0030 hope that there are plans
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0031 both in cyprus and in other governments
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0032 we see
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0033 the result of the european government
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0034 on cyprus
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0035 cyprus
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0036 to seek
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0037 help from russia
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0038 this is a very sad development the european union project
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0039 role moscow from on russia has
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0040 a near
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0041 to a large extent of gas supply
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0042 to continental europe
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0043 and there are significant gas
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0044 in the territorial waters off cyprus
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0045 from an economic perspective
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0046 blackmail that european governments have on cyprus is essentially pushing cyprus to work with russia and this is lead to higher gas prices and tremendous economic cost for europe i
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0047 that european leaders can actually
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0048 their responsibilities and find a european solution to this
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0049 do think
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0050 germany
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0051 change its game plan when they have already said not going to
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0054 known that
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0055 the that the cypriot government was blackmailed was because of an internal dispute associated with
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0056 the september elections
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0057 what is going to happen when the banks re open and what the consequences for the other fragile economies such in greece spain and portugal under the circumstances difficult to
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0058 banks in cyprus before a solution to the situation is
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0060 how would
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0061 a
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0062 with his deposits in spanish banks for example feel
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0063 that european governments
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0064 do the same with spain
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0065 from the european union frankly is this what the
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0066 of spain
20130101_20130531_en_adjw-0067 france or even germany want do we really want to see the death of the european union project

20130101_20130531_en_adld-0003 visited moscow that diplomatic speak
20130101_20130531_en_adld-0004 a
20130101_20130531_en_adld-0005 what is going on
20130101_20130531_en_adld-0006 i think
20130101_20130531_en_adld-0008 brussels and moscow have
20130101_20130531_en_adld-0009 significant interests in cyprus
20130101_20130531_en_adld-0010 however i think
20130101_20130531_en_adld-0011 financial assistance
20130101_20130531_en_adld-0012 of a direct nature
20130101_20130531_en_adld-0013 will very prudent from moscow and it will be very much on hard nosed commercial terms russia obviously needs an
20130101_20130531_en_adld-0014 in
20130101_20130531_en_adld-0015 do think
20130101_20130531_en_adld-0016 abandon syria in favour of more useful cyprus as an ally
20130101_20130531_en_adld-0017 to put
20130101_20130531_en_adld-0018 in one basket neither syria or cyprus it would prefer
20130101_20130531_en_adld-0019 its cake and eat it
20130101_20130531_en_adld-0020 speculation is that cyprus offer russia access to untapped gas reserves in return for russian aid something europe would be keen to avoid
20130101_20130531_en_adle-0002 in the present situation i think there is definitely a systemic risk
20130101_20130531_en_adle-0003 and
20130101_20130531_en_adle-0004 i think that
20130101_20130531_en_adle-0005 the unrest of the last couple of days has proven this unfortunately
20130101_20130531_en_adle-0006 mistakes were made but the basic ie is sound
20130101_20130531_en_adle-0007 a chairman you have to find the compromise between the different countries between the different perspectives and goals that we out together
20130101_20130531_en_adle-0008 and therefore this decision
20130101_20130531_en_adle-0009 was not stopped by me because it was a compromise which together the different interests the different goals that we share what is clear is that previous bank bailouts are a thing of the past
20130101_20130531_en_adlf-0001 the
20130101_20130531_en_adlf-0003 for the first time
20130101_20130531_en_adlf-0004 the four satellites currently
20130101_20130531_en_adlf-0005 the earth are transmitting their navigation messages
20130101_20130531_en_adlf-0006 the fully operational service should be in two thousand
20130101_20130531_en_adlf-0007 several years later than first hoped
20130101_20130531_en_adlf-0008 costs have also risen
20130101_20130531_en_adlf-0009 but the scientists remain optimistic
20130101_20130531_en_adlf-0010 we have done the first positioning using european only means the four
20130101_20130531_en_adlf-0011 and
20130101_20130531_en_adlf-0012 twelve a of ground stations of course is less spectacular than a launch but for us is
20130101_20130531_en_adlf-0013 first time we know that
20130101_20130531_en_adlf-0014 we very confident for the full
20130101_20130531_en_adlf-0015 the
20130101_20130531_en_adlf-0016 infrastructure and is undergoing the in orbit validation phase to check that the is working as expected the fully deployed system will thirty satellites and the associated ground
20130101_20130531_en_adlf-0017 we have been able to measure
20130101_20130531_en_adlf-0018 the accuracy performance in the range of ten metres this of course not
20130101_20130531_en_adlf-0019 the levels of performance we want to achieve in the future it is still
20130101_20130531_en_adlf-0020 not
20130101_20130531_en_adlf-0021 but in future this performance will be improved gradually by deployment of more satellites more ground stations and we will also disseminate to users additional information we cannot produce
20130101_20130531_en_adlf-0022 today because we need to complete
20130101_20130531_en_adlf-0023 if everything works well will have a state of the art global satellite navigation system providing an accurate guaranteed global positioning service under civilian control

20130101_20130531_en_adlg-0004 to that that we all have it within ourselves we have

20130101_20130531_en_adlg-0006 and i think
20130101_20130531_en_adlg-0007 that is

20130101_20130531_en_adlh-0014 scary i think
20130101_20130531_en_adlh-0015 a couple of days because it quickly turned around into being an exciting prospect
20130101_20130531_en_adlh-0016 in the position i am on my third
20130101_20130531_en_adlh-0017 great be outside sort major

20130101_20130531_en_adlh-0020 just lose creative
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0001 all its years of clashes with the kurds turkey has finally decided that
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0002 efforts may be more effective than its military
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0003 turkish armed forces are second only to the americans in nato in strength and kurdish forces continued to defy them a clear and sustainable upper hand in the troubled southeast
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0004 the killing grounds only remote kurdish villages but cities in
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0005 and european territory arenas for
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0006 but the ninety also saw counter disappearances and executions meanwhile the kurds kept calling for a recognised political identity
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0007 terrorism is a separate issue
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0008 until now we have fought them and i hope they have realised that armed struggle is not a solution
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0009 turkey is determined on our own initiative take
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0010 develop our democracy
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0011 in that way we can put an end to the criticism we have received
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0012 increasing soft power would allow ankara more room to pursue its international ambitions
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0015 so
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0016 grand ambitions for the middle east and for regional leadership
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0017 the have this bleeding internal struggle
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0019 i think this political intervention by the turkish government is a very positive step
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0020 this whole conflict makes us all nervous
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0021 mothers and fathers
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0022 our soldiers
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0023 our turkish and kurdish citizens
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0024 we all grew up
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0025 and most people support it
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0026 a city of million people
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0027 on the banks of the river
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0028 is the biggest majority kurdish city in turkey
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0029 people been living here since the stone age but in recent
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0030 it has got poorer as dragged on and ankara sought to repress the kurdish culture
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0032 the next step
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0033 what will happen
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0034 i think it will be like this if withdrawal realised the parliament is expected to take a decision
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0035 the most important here is the security of the
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0036 forces who are withdrawing
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0037 i think government should take responsibility for this
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0038 we should be very sensitive it
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0039 ninety-nine during a withdrawal
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0040 security forces opened fire and many people were killed
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0041 so there is a distrust here
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0042 we have to overcome
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0043 this
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0044 prime minister says he will guarantee that
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0045 but his words must be backed up actions
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0046 after the withdrawal there should be a for their return to
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0047 their re integration into daily life
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0049 but at the same time not only a problem of
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0050 there should be a solution to
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0051 question in a peaceful and a democratic way
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0052 other steps should also be
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0053 what are these
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0054 of
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0055 this is a constitutional problem
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0056 you know the parliament is working on a new constitution
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0057 the new constitution should be democratic and should provide for the resolution of the kurdish problem
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0058 the definition of citizenship must be
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0059 the
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0060 constitution should recognise all ethnic groups and everyone equally should be neutral
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0061 it should not be a barrier to education in a native
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0062 all these steps provide a solution for the kurdish
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0063 education in their native language definition citizenship and participation of everyone in the decision making
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0064 i mean governing themselves
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0065 slogan of the kurdish new year is
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0066 status to
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0067 do you think there will be any change
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0068 situation
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0070 does not want his personal situation to be part of the process right now
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0071 it is understood that this may be an issue later in process
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0072 in the future that can be discussed
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0073 if we achieve peace here
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0075 and society can solve this problem
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0076 at the end this process do you think the
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0077 be solved for good will the conflict finally end
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0078 first of peace is difficult
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0079 making peace cannot around the table among a few people
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0080 this important but talking about making peace between communities
20130101_20130531_en_adli-0081 for that reason it will take time
20130101_20130531_en_adlj-0001 the
20130101_20130531_en_adlj-0002 scientists have traced a unique map of the first light of the universe and raised profound questions about the big bang

20130101_20130531_en_adlj-0012 image most of this map fits beautifully our very simple
20130101_20130531_en_adlj-0013 at the same time we find some strange

20130101_20130531_en_adpl-0004 it is a natural treasure that as with other european coastal lagoons is facing huge threats
20130101_20130531_en_adpl-0005 among the most common we find here is the high presence of nutrients the water
20130101_20130531_en_adpl-0006 these nutrients favour the bloom of green algae
20130101_20130531_en_adpl-0007 the green algae oxygen from the water and eventually the whole aquatic ecosystem can lose its environmental health and quality
20130101_20130531_en_adpl-0009 the
20130101_20130531_en_adpl-0010 climate change could also pose dangerous threats
20130101_20130531_en_adpl-0011 could alter volumes of water in the lagoon the

20130101_20130531_en_adpl-0020 of course there is a large uncertainty but we to remember that
20130101_20130531_en_adpl-0021 we are collecting the best available
20130101_20130531_en_adpl-0022 scientific
20130101_20130531_en_adpl-0023 this is not science fiction
20130101_20130531_en_adpl-0025 provide them with maps
20130101_20130531_en_adpl-0026 we them to use dots and colours to show us on those maps which areas of the lagoons they feel are developing well
20130101_20130531_en_adpl-0027 and which areas
20130101_20130531_en_adpl-0028 besides getting information about which issues
20130101_20130531_en_adpl-0029 there are at stake we also get
20130101_20130531_en_adpl-0030 a three year research effort scientists hunters and fishermen hope will help to preserve some quite unique natural ecosystems
20130101_20130531_en_adpl-0031 we have the sea then the sea inlet then the lagoon
20130101_20130531_en_adpl-0032 and then nothing else except of motorways there is no more space for wildlife
20130101_20130531_en_adpl-0033 so all hunting friendly spots around this
20130101_20130531_en_adpl-0034 are in the lagoon
20130101_20130531_en_adpl-0035 why we hunters also have to fight to protect it and preserve the natural balance of these ecosystems
20130101_20130531_en_adpl-0036 each lagoon is unique if we lose this heritage we will also lose a bit of own identity

20130101_20130531_en_adpo-0012 the enormous mineral resources for which africa is a rich source and africa is also a market for chinese manufactured goods
20130101_20130531_en_adpo-0013 bilateral trade therefore is booming
20130101_20130531_en_adpo-0014 total trade between china and the african continent went from seven seven billion euros in two thousand

20130101_20130531_en_adpo-0020 agriculture
20130101_20130531_en_adpo-0023 so we need technology
20130101_20130531_en_adpo-0024 we need the technology that is going to help us
20130101_20130531_en_adpo-0025 in
20130101_20130531_en_adpo-0026 the growth process
20130101_20130531_en_adpo-0027 china has been developing its term strategy in africa many

20130101_20130531_en_adpo-0029 china to more than one eight hundred kilometre long railway from dar es salaam to zambia
20130101_20130531_en_adpo-0031 evident that this route and these countries were not chosen by chance by the new chinese leader for his first overseas trip
20130101_20130531_en_adpo-0032 his route very clearly tells us about the priorities of modern china and the new
20130101_20130531_en_adpo-0033 government
20130101_20130531_en_adpo-0034 tells us about the priorities in foreign policy as china keeps an eye on the future
20130101_20130531_en_adpo-0035 and in the view of the new chinese authorities russia is moving into the position forming a very close and intimate alliance
20130101_20130531_en_adpo-0037 beijing
20130101_20130531_en_adpo-0038 to
20130101_20130531_en_adpo-0039 and strengthen its influence
20130101_20130531_en_adpo-0040 in fact the development china needs on one hand security in the north
20130101_20130531_en_adpo-0041 this security in a global way will be guaranteed by the russian chinese relationship
20130101_20130531_en_adpo-0042 on the other hand a considerable mineral resources
20130101_20130531_en_adpo-0043 which has used for further developing the chinese
20130101_20130531_en_adpo-0044 largest part of this market is africa now
20130101_20130531_en_adpo-0046 the first stop in his first official overseas trip a symbolic gesture what kind of relationship can today between russia and china
20130101_20130531_en_adpo-0048 if speak about
20130101_20130531_en_adpo-0049 it has become increasingly evident that the relationship with the usa has entered a very complicated period of struggle
20130101_20130531_en_adpo-0053 in this situation russia has a huge interest in consolidating the
20130101_20130531_en_adpo-0054 with china
20130101_20130531_en_adpo-0055 and looks at not just as an economic alternative but also a political one
20130101_20130531_en_adpo-0057 especially when comes to negotiations with the european union and america
20130101_20130531_en_adpo-0058 you have already mentioned africa one russian newspaper called the continent a trump card in a global game which is played rather successfully especially by china has beijing got opponents in this game
20130101_20130531_en_adpo-0059 yes of course this
20130101_20130531_en_adpo-0060 struggle is
20130101_20130531_en_adpo-0061 and you can see it in different spheres
20130101_20130531_en_adpo-0063 in our russian press and in the west in general the point of view deals with the fighting against the islamists radicals extremists and the fight against their attempts to take over this african country
20130101_20130531_en_adpo-0064 but look at the
20130101_20130531_en_adpo-0065 press
20130101_20130531_en_adpo-0066 they write that the purpose of this military operation is really the aim of moving china out of cutting china off from mineral
20130101_20130531_en_adpo-0067 especially rare earth minerals that are found in mali
20130101_20130531_en_adpo-0068 and that beijing has plans to exploit
20130101_20130531_en_adpo-0069 it looks like the main aim of the military operation is to force china out from the south of the sahara indeed africa is becoming battlefield in a very tense struggle
20130101_20130531_en_adpo-0070 former colonial
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0003 will be shifted over to bank cyprus a percentage of those bigger
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0004 probably around thirty percent though that has not yet been
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0006 daniel gros director of the centre for european
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0007 studies in brussels
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0008 reacted positively the cyprus deal
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0009 despite the
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0010 one of banks
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0011 think people have now got used to the
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0012 that if a bank has a problem it should be a problem for the creditors of the bank and not so much for the government
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0013 this
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0014 been established i think it makes sense
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0015 and markets have taken it very well the government of cyprus
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0016 losses private investors namely
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0017 other small countries
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0018 similar
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0019 maybe luxembourg slovenia the risk of contagion still
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0020 the risk of contagion should be quite limited the case of cyprus was really unique in several
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0021 has also very large banks
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0022 one crucial difference the banks in luxembourg are all owned by other banks in the eurozone so the luxembourg government will never be responsible for anything that happens in luxembourg
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0024 and therefore there should be no noticeable contagion
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0025 anyhow a good solution for the eurozone
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0026 it harder on the people and the economy of cyprus in fact all
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0027 said that
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0028 unemployment recession austerity so the german model prevailed again this was you want the least bad solution the people of cyprus could expect
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0029 because with the losses now being by the creditors of the banks that means the people of cyprus will not have to pay
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0030 to make up for these losses
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0031 that the economy would
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0032 there would be loss of
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0033 but that is inherent in the fact that the business model of cyprus has been destroyed
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0034 and cyprus take time to
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0035 anyway we see people angry in the streets
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0036 anti german
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0037 on rise again
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0038 responsibility for that with the government cyprus which has portrayed the german government and the troika as the bad guys which to impose losses on the people of cyprus
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0039 opposite was the case
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0040 so you mean that the deal could have been done in the first
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0042 afterwards it was necessary to have some theatre
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0043 so that could actually show
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0044 say
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0045 and the parliament of cyprus
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0046 say
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0047 but then
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0048 if
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0049 then the cost for
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0050 economy extremely high
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0051 so in the end agreed to a solution
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0052 keeps the damage to a minimum so do you think
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0053 deal is also important in terms of the future of the banking union
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0054 taxpayers will see how can
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0055 in the
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0057 supervision
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0058 know all the detailed information
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0059 to
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0060 have
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0061 this will be available the troika and therefore say
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0062 under these conditions we can go into this
20130101_20130531_en_adpp-0063 project banking union because the dangers for us as german taxpayers are very limited
20130101_20130531_en_adpq-0001 have all heard the warnings about screens being bad for children but now a french study from the influential academy of sciences claims that playing with computers touchpads and video games actually be good for even young children
20130101_20130531_en_adpq-0002 a simple rules are followed

20130101_20130531_en_adpq-0007 abstract thinking and problem solving
20130101_20130531_en_adpq-0008 this is the key message if you educate the child to use video screens that child is going to learn how to use different of brain
20130101_20130531_en_adpq-0009 researchers said parents need to explain that a touchpad or a computer is a means to learning or having fun
20130101_20130531_en_adpq-0010 because a medium of exchange that it allows the child to discover only what we can do with the internet but it allows him to name what he sees to learn how to interact to learn to

20130101_20130531_en_adpt-0006 was
20130101_20130531_en_adpt-0007 cyprus was one step away from financial collapse
20130101_20130531_en_adpt-0008 our choices were not easy
20130101_20130531_en_adpt-0009 and the
20130101_20130531_en_adpt-0010 was not ideal
20130101_20130531_en_adpt-0011 but after tough negotiations
20130101_20130531_en_adpt-0012 with persistence and also a sense of responsibility

20130101_20130531_en_adse-0001 a french study of fourteen patients with hiv who have remained healthy for years despite stopping treatment has offered fresh evidence early
20130101_20130531_en_adse-0002 could lead to a so
20130101_20130531_en_adse-0003 functional cure for aids
20130101_20130531_en_adse-0004 it comes after news a girl appeared to be cured of hiv after aggressive anti
20130101_20130531_en_adse-0005 drug treatment within thirty hours of birth
20130101_20130531_en_adse-0006 scientists in france said the fourteen patients were treated within ten weeks of being infected
20130101_20130531_en_adse-0008 after an acute infection hiv establishes viral reservoirs in cells that allow it to hide and return even after prolonged treatment
20130101_20130531_en_adse-0009 meaning that most people who stop taking medication see the infection
20130101_20130531_en_adse-0010 it is not unlikely that these subjects could escape the disease one day they have had more than seven years without treatment without treatment and without toxicity which is huge anyway
20130101_20130531_en_adse-0011 why these fourteen patients can fight hiv without drugs whereas the majority of people who receive early treatment cannot it may be that in their cases the early treatment could have limited the establishment of the viral reservoirs and preserved their immune responses
20130101_20130531_en_adse-0012 scientists are continuing to study the group for clues

20130101_20130531_en_adte-0004 but france which is the second largest economy will not be growing possibly at all in thirteen and possibly start growing again in the latter part of this year and italy continues to be in recession although recession is shrinking which means that italy might see positive growth at the end of
20130101_20130531_en_adte-0005 the european central bank would be justified in cutting interest rates as inflation is low and an explicit indication of its future intentions for rates could be needed

20130101_20130531_en_adtf-0003 to back government stimulus measures but analyst is not hopeful that they will work my expectations
20130101_20130531_en_adtf-0004 unfortunately this is exactly same remedies we have been having in the last fifteen
20130101_20130531_en_adtf-0006 and i have my grave doubts whether going to be effective in changing structurally the japanese economy except providing a
20130101_20130531_en_adtf-0008 to push ahead anyway
20130101_20130531_en_adtg-0002 four percent annual growth rate economists had predicted it would be slightly better there was a big in business investment and higher exports of services but growth was the slowest since the first quarter of eleven far from needed cut the us

20130101_20130531_en_adti-0001 am chris burns and welcome to i talk some call strip mining of the seas over fishing that is wiping out fish stocks sometimes to the point of near extinction and what about the safety and quality of the fish we eat
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0003 commissioner before we get to that i ask
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0004 about your home country greece
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0005 a whole show that what is your prognosis positive negative of the economic situation we can be slightly
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0006 now we have
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0007 very very hard years three or four very very hard years
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0008 cuts on
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0009 pensions thirty percent almost thirty percent unemployment this is a really disaster
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0010 to the breaking point socially but
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0011 still
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0012 i am still optimistic why because we can a slight light now at the end of the tunnel for the first time greece has a surplus and are some reforms ongoing and we are expecting
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0013 some tourists a lot of tourists actually this summer so going this way i think that at the end we are to earn the game but the difficulties are
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0014 we still have to keep our fingers crossed
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0018 support our cause
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0019 the last obstacle in common fishery policy reform is the of some member states like spain france and ireland
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0020 the commission and the parliament
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0021 but the question is what is going to happen now the negotiations include fishery ministers
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0022 you very much
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0024 the
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0025 happen
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0026 well
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0027 i am optimistic i have to say that
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0028 there is a possibility of down if we are going through a negotiation a compromise
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0029 perhaps there are some possibilities for watering down but i am optimistic because
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0030 of these people because
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0031 we have heard almost a million of signatures for this so about discarding this is a huge problem now twenty-three percent is
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0032 figure
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0033 our
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0034 are
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0035 back the sea
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0036 percent and in some fisheries up to eighty percent
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0038 so i think everybody now has understood that and we had a good approach in the council between the ministers
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0039 no exceptions which is very important but of course time
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0040 is still at
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0042 why does europe allow high levels of when we all know that there are not many fish left
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0044 straight question
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0045 trying this is the answer but we are not there yet so what we to do and this is
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0046 our reform is about we have
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0047 to be sure that what we going to remove from the sea is
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0048 a good quantity that can leave our stocks in good health in order to
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0049 this what we call maximum sustainability so i can say that if our reform will be in place then we can have a very good prognosis because after
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0050 twenty-two
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0051 almost all stocks are going to be fished in a sustainable way and this means that
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0052 almost thirty
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0054 making jobs
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0055 as well well yes we have to the balance
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0056 this is what i am saying about my job my job is just to keep the
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0057 between the social consequences and what we can do about
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0059 is
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0060 i would like to ask a question to the commissioner in charge of maritime affairs
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0061 like to know what the commission
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0062 to ensure our health
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0063 when it comes to on our plates
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0064 especially
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0066 yes
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0068 have to depend on our imports
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0069 sixty-three sixty-four percent of the fish
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0070 ends up
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0071 our
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0072 well have some checks yes but we cannot check every fish
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0073 you can imagine
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0074 of
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0075 fish come from other regions
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0076 tougher on
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0077 we are getting tougher because we really to control situation so we have a lot of instruments in our hands now
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0078 instruments and also we can
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0079 and even stop imports is
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0080 the last
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0081 punishment
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0082 but we can even stop
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0083 from some
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0084 countries from vessels if we are not sure they are
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0085 in a legal way another related question on
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0087 what they
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0088 coordinate the slow fish campaign for slow food on
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0090 use our oceans better while preserving their integrity if we continue to manage fisheries with
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0091 approach when interaction among the whole trophic chain the
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0092 the
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0093 is a little bit like wanting to take care of the forest by putting farms in it
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0095 saying if is fresh or defrosted
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0096 and when it was fished
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0097 and then we also to take care of aquaculture because aquaculture can be an
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0098 to
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0099 since we cannot
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0100 right yes it to be done so our new financial instrument is going to ring fence some money especially for aquaculture aquaculture in the sea but also in fresh water so all the countries the member states even the landlocked countries are now interested about having aquaculture projects and to produce fish am
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0101 these last questions if we can this one from greenpeace about quotas
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0104 i have to be sincere this will be very difficult
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0105 but what we can do is
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0106 of conditionality referring to the money we are
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0107 to our
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0109 if they are not going to reduce over capacity one final question about sustainable fishing have a
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0110 and
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0111 ask about
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0112 fishing
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0113 why the europeans allow fishing
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0114 sustainable
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0115 and what
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0116 what going to is turn up the way we are going to give money now
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0117 to give money to small scale vessels we are going
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0118 to
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0119 local communities local fishermen also we are going to give them money in order to
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0120 local economies the spouses to cook the fish to process the fish this is way to
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0121 small scale vessels and local economies through a positive
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0122 and of course have
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0123 limit a little the way our huge vessels huge trawlers are fishing is balancing all those interests thank you
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0124 much
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0125 tackling these
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0126 and glad you join us on i
20130101_20130531_en_adtj-0001 a new exhibition of items from
20130101_20130531_en_adtj-0002 and herculaneum opened at the british museum in london
20130101_20130531_en_adtj-0003 the two cities on the bay of naples in southern italy were buried in just twenty-four hours by a volcanic eruption of mount vesuvius in
20130101_20130531_en_adtj-0004 seventy-nine
20130101_20130531_en_adtj-0005 the cities were naturally preserved until they were rediscovered by archaeologists nearly one
20130101_20130531_en_adtj-0006 seven hundred years and
20130101_20130531_en_adtj-0008 of combative
20130101_20130531_en_adtj-0010 they see in the exhibition objects familiar with that they use everyday that romans used two thousand years ago
20130101_20130531_en_adtj-0011 to their different locations pompeii and herculaneum were buried different ways and this has affected the preservation of materials at each site
20130101_20130531_en_adtj-0013 upper storeys remained intact and the hotter ash preserved wooden household objects beds
20130101_20130531_en_adtj-0014 and even food
20130101_20130531_en_adtj-0015 the exhibition life and death in pompeii and herculaneum runs until the end of september

20130101_20130531_en_adtk-0002 and the designs on display
20130101_20130531_en_adtk-0004 in the

20130101_20130531_en_adtl-0001 liver transplants are carried out each year in europe and united states
20130101_20130531_en_adtl-0002 donor organs are preserved by cooling them to slow their metabolism but this
20130101_20130531_en_adtl-0003 often damages them but now scientists at oxford university
20130101_20130531_en_adtl-0004 have managed to a donated functioning at body temperature before the transplant operation
20130101_20130531_en_adtl-0005 this new technology could keep a liver functioning outside the body for up to twenty-four hours
20130101_20130531_en_adtl-0006 a donated human liver connected to device is raised body temperature and oxygenated red cells are circulated through its capillaries once on this machine a liver functions just as it would inside a body
20130101_20130531_en_adtl-0007 and
20130101_20130531_en_adtl-0008 this new technology could also prevent donated livers being discarded because they are either damaged by oxygen deprivation or do not survive the cold
20130101_20130531_en_adtl-0009 process this machine could therefore double the number of organs
20130101_20130531_en_adtl-0010 for
20130101_20130531_en_adtl-0011 transplant
20130101_20130531_en_adtl-0012 the
20130101_20130531_en_adtl-0014 this february suggest that the device be useful for all patients needing liver transplants

20130101_20130531_en_adut-0006 that membership would result in increased centralisation and would be less favourable conditions for equality and the welfare state
20130101_20130531_en_adut-0007 fishing is extremely important to the norwegian economy especially for coastal areas it is the second largest industry in country after
20130101_20130531_en_adut-0008 but we must immediately say that economically norway is part of the eu internal market
20130101_20130531_en_adut-0009 the question may be a bit misleading in fact we are strongly integrated in the european union even if we are not members
20130101_20130531_en_adut-0010 economically we are equal with other states through the agreement on the european economic area the so called
20130101_20130531_en_adut-0011 since ninety-four norway has participated fully in the internal market

20130101_20130531_en_adut-0015 the norwegian economy is strong unemployment is low
20130101_20130531_en_adut-0016 norwegians therefore see no economic argument in favour of eu membership

20130101_20130531_en_adwr-0005 research program which brought together a group of enterprises and the cork institute of technology the two main ingredients are titanium dioxide and
20130101_20130531_en_adwr-0006 we load the glass spheres into little
20130101_20130531_en_adwr-0007 we then use the

20130101_20130531_en_adwr-0014 uv irradiation is commonly used for water purification
20130101_20130531_en_adwr-0015 rays kill many bacteria and viruses
20130101_20130531_en_adwr-0016 the mercury lamps not environmentally friendly and costly to run researchers from the cork institute of technology worked on uv leds lamps firstly they
20130101_20130531_en_adwr-0017 uv wavelengths process
20130101_20130531_en_adwr-0018 down to fibre
20130101_20130531_en_adwr-0019 and detector
20130101_20130531_en_adwr-0020 detector we get an image displayed on the screen
20130101_20130531_en_adwr-0021 which tells us about the intensity and distribution of the light that comes the
20130101_20130531_en_adwr-0022 we can use that detail and that data to characterize the
20130101_20130531_en_adwr-0023 we can use it to operate an efficient level and that tells us about the inputs we need for different models when we model the
20130101_20130531_en_adwr-0024 we modulate the intensity of the uv light measure the
20130101_20130531_en_adwr-0025 of beams which arrive on the surface to optimize the distance between the uv source and the dish
20130101_20130531_en_adwr-0026 of the chemical reaction depends on the intensity and spectrum of the uv light therefore we can calculate at which speed the water will be purified
20130101_20130531_en_adwr-0027 technology is a
20130101_20130531_en_adwr-0028 one of the biggest increases in technology is in the field of uv according to the project coordinator
20130101_20130531_en_adwr-0029 technology is
20130101_20130531_en_adwr-0031 they can bring the leds into their process and into their
20130101_20130531_en_adwr-0032 is an effective way of getting rid of low concentrations of pollutants uv irradiated
20130101_20130531_en_adwr-0033 is more powerful than chlorine

20130101_20130531_en_adwr-0037 clean high concentrations of pollutants but there is certain
20130101_20130531_en_adwr-0038 which is very hard to remove so
20130101_20130531_en_adwr-0040 is very useful we realised that
20130101_20130531_en_adwr-0041 the big companies are not all that keen
20130101_20130531_en_adwr-0042 on this of
20130101_20130531_en_adwr-0043 cleaning and
20130101_20130531_en_adwr-0044 this a little bit too expensive also and
20130101_20130531_en_adwr-0045 a
20130101_20130531_en_adwr-0046 with this reactor the group might show larger water purification devices could useful for big companies

20130101_20130531_en_adws-0004 hundred off the ground to monitor all manner of illegal activity
20130101_20130531_en_adws-0005 been developed by the italian swiss company aerial view which says can help search for missing persons or be used as part of civil protection programmes
20130101_20130531_en_adws-0006 all the drones have a transmitter that sends in real time the video signal from the camera to a ground station where there is hd monitor that can visualise what the camera is recording
20130101_20130531_en_adws-0007 you can see the same pictures with special glasses which have inside a micro monitor you wear these glasses you have the same sensation as you would watch a forty-two inch monitor
20130101_20130531_en_adws-0008 easily operated remote control and highly manoeuvrable the drone is equipped with a wireless transmitter which helps provide instant results
20130101_20130531_en_adws-0009 the drone makes it easy to track subjects over difficult terrain such as rocks and water and to film at low altitude where helicopters cannot fly
20130101_20130531_en_adws-0011 or infra red cameras they can be operated at night too but close perfect weather conditions are needed best results
20130101_20130531_en_adws-0012 drones are

20130101_20130531_en_adwt-0008 you take something that would be graphic in the
20130101_20130531_en_adwt-0009 in
20130101_20130531_en_adwt-0010 and i think that takes all the creepiness out of it and you
20130101_20130531_en_adwt-0011 and
20130101_20130531_en_adwt-0012 the
20130101_20130531_en_adwt-0013 the explicit erotic tale is through dance and familiar pop hits and the writers are sure their twisted version has something to please everyone

20130101_20130531_en_adwt-0017 but
20130101_20130531_en_adwt-0018 is a fun one without a doubt and
20130101_20130531_en_adwt-0019 i love that our crowd is like typically like women and middle aged women
20130101_20130531_en_adwt-0020 may
20130101_20130531_en_adwt-0022 very
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0001 there is growing concern the steady decline the number of people
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0002 eu elections
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0003 raises a fundamental question
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0004 just how can the europe of the future be built without the participation
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0005 of
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0006 getting people to exercise their right vote and strengthen
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0007 legitimacy a challenge for authorities everywhere
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0008 at the last eu elections two thousand just forty-three percent of eligible
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0009 out
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0010 three decades earlier the figure was just under sixty-two percent
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0011 hoping to better the next european polls
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0012 fourteen is slovakia an eu member since two thousand four
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0013 it scored the worst turnout at the last two ballots for the european parliament with less than one in five casting a vote
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0014 belgium and luxembourg scored best with more than ninety percent turnout but they both have compulsory voting
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0015 bratislava met a typical family never voted in
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0016 elections
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0017 has her own cosmetics business her daughter sylvia whose baby girl emily is six months old works in information technology sector
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0019 very information it in the first place and i viewed it as distant from my problems
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0020 i was concerned with myself and slovakia and europe was still very distant to me the and
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0021 a
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0022 i was too young before and had other interests
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0023 young people are interested in other things
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0026 some people they are tired of so many rounds of various elections
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0027 hard enough to up with complicated national politics
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0028 others say they are happy not to vote after years of being forced to cast a ballot prior to independence in ninety-three
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0030 stress that it did go up three per cent between the last two european
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0031 but admit more effort is needed
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0032 still
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0033 very low turnout but we are already closer to other member states but not
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0034 a consolation for us this is still a challenge we have to work on how to really increase the interest in the european parliament in the european elections how to really
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0035 create a platform for dialogue between our meps
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0036 and different target groups like stakeholders multipliers
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0037 also
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0038 public
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0039 but raising interest is easy task for part the european commission has issued a formal recommendation
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0040 it says national political parties should make it clear in campaigning which european parties are affiliated with
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0041 and to boost the political tempo
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0042 parties are being told to nominate a candidate for european president and make that known to voters ahead of election day
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0043 the european parliament elects the president based on a proposal by eu leaders who are supposed to take into account the election results
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0044 another recommendation to spark more interest is to make elections one single event the commission wants to move away from tradition of spreading the voting out over four day
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0045 member states are being urged to agree on one single date
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0046 but achieving a deal on that looks likely to difficult
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0047 some observers the recommendation is a step in the right direction is still not enough
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0048 the commission has to be more dependent on the parliament and election results political parties also have to communicate better
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0049 basically what they have to citizens is that they can change something
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0050 this or that party
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0051 the european parliament they can
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0052 in the direction
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0053 of the
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0055 or enough
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0056 they
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0057 they can change they can change the political course
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0058 most parties are yet to reveal their strategies for the next eu elections but already there calls for information that is accessible and easy to digest
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0059 well known personalities were more involved in the presentation of the elections
20130101_20130531_en_adwu-0060 people would become more familiar with the issues and might be prompted to go and vote

20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0022 firstly what you think about the four months of lying by the former budget minister and his adamant denials publicly playing at offended and outraged
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0023 this is going to leave lots of
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0024 this is a disaster for political credibility
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0025 which had already lost a lot of in france
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0027 the
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0028 government wanted to return to moral public discourse
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0029 and what has happened is quite rigorously just the opposite so this political crisis is just getting started
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0031 he was the budget minister someone who is supposed to set an example to fight tax fraud
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0034 was doubtless chosen to reassure the markets
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0035 how to explain to the french people they have to make sacrifices when the height of state power these words are not being respected
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0036 political error goes down badly especially when ordinary people are having a difficult time but the lying has been seen as even worse the french showed this in their reactions this morning
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0037 is a shared thing politics
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0038 the french are convinced that politicians are constantly lying to them
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0039 and here they have the proof a minister confessing which is quite exceptional
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0040 opposition the media in the street are attacking this so called
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0042 wanted
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0043 what impact will this have on the government and the president
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0044 it comes the worst time
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0049 and a demand for transparency for whose benefit
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0050 the french are demanding the truth yes but i think in way that stopped believing and the most serious thing of all we are in a political crisis which has gone so far as to become a moral crisis of democracy itself
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0051 i was going to ask you this discrediting of the political class is it good democracy
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0053 there will be a price to pay at the next elections in
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0054 it will as no surprise that the extremes notably extreme right
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0055 make the most
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0056 of
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0057 it
20130101_20130531_en_adzo-0003 but normalising relations with
20130101_20130531_en_adzo-0004 is key if belgrade is to ever realise its goal of joining the
20130101_20130531_en_adzo-0005 the serbian economy contracted by one seven percent last year and eu
20130101_20130531_en_adzo-0006 would attract new investment from abroad
20130101_20130531_en_adzo-0007 but first there is the thorny issue of
20130101_20130531_en_adzo-0009 a bid to end the deadlock serbia has offered to recognise the authority of pristina over that part of the country
20130101_20130531_en_adzo-0010 the disagreement stems from how much autonomy the
20130101_20130531_en_adzo-0011 serbs living
20130101_20130531_en_adzo-0012 there

20130101_20130531_en_adzq-0004 the only way to it is to go there
20130101_20130531_en_adzq-0006 the most important aspect of the scandal is what is impacting most on french democracy
20130101_20130531_en_adzq-0007 what is unprecedented is the democratic earthquake has set off by this scandal

20130101_20130531_en_adzq-0015 is the democratic earthquake
20130101_20130531_en_adzq-0019 and today we see this almost oligarchic world somewhere between politics money and the media
20130101_20130531_en_adzq-0021 that the head the tax department was
20130101_20130531_en_adzq-0022 a fraudster
20130101_20130531_en_adzq-0023 all french people understand that this is a scandal of public virtue and public morals

20130101_20130531_en_aeev-0003 it tells the story of an american couple travelled to vienna during war to evacuate infants at risk of persecution
20130101_20130531_en_aeev-0004 and then them
20130101_20130531_en_aeev-0005 to
20130101_20130531_en_aeev-0006 it was a wonderful opportunity to shine a light on this unknown this little
20130101_20130531_en_aeev-0007 holocaust story
20130101_20130531_en_aeev-0008 i think more importantly to also shine a much deserved spotlight on this extraordinary couple and
20130101_20130531_en_aeev-0009 an opportunity to
20130101_20130531_en_aeev-0010 hopefully inspire people
20130101_20130531_en_aeev-0011 with this story of the ability of basically ordinary people to achieve an extraordinary result under very trying

20130101_20130531_en_aeez-0004 and
20130101_20130531_en_aefa-0001 there are around one
20130101_20130531_en_aefa-0002 sporting facilities in
20130101_20130531_en_aefa-0003 helping people have fun healthy and
20130101_20130531_en_aefa-0004 places like gyms swimming pools indoor playing courts and even outdoor playing courts consume massive amounts of energy
20130101_20130531_en_aefa-0005 of
20130101_20130531_en_aefa-0006 for the
20130101_20130531_en_aefa-0007 our objective was to develop a modular scalable platform able to respond to four big
20130101_20130531_en_aefa-0008 how when why and where
20130101_20130531_en_aefa-0009 is used inside sport facilities to answer those questions we have developed four independent modules designed to monitor control and optimise the
20130101_20130531_en_aefa-0010 consumption
20130101_20130531_en_aefa-0011 the managers of the real situation in different areas within the sports facility
20130101_20130531_en_aefa-0012 sports centre near rome was used as pilot site to test the platform it has a network of sensors around indoor swimming pool to
20130101_20130531_en_aefa-0013 the energy used for lighting heating cooling air quality and ventilation and the
20130101_20130531_en_aefa-0014 for users
20130101_20130531_en_aefa-0015 some surprising discoveries
20130101_20130531_en_aefa-0016 have for instance us understand that there is a huge temperature variation due to the position of the swimming pool and its ventilation system there is around seven degrees celsius difference between the north and the south facing sides so in space there is a huge variation in thermo hydrometric conditions these optimised sensors allow us to calculate that variation in an accurate affordable way
20130101_20130531_en_aefa-0017 data from the swimming pool and other sports areas was then sent to a central module to be analysed after checking complimentary data like weather forecasting or planned facility usage it can optimise energy consumption
20130101_20130531_en_aefa-0018 us the
20130101_20130531_en_aefa-0019 sensors allow us to measure the energy consumption in the gym the swimming pool the dressing rooms the administration office all the different spaces inside this facility
20130101_20130531_en_aefa-0020 the platform has sensors allow us to monitor temperature and humidity in different areas
20130101_20130531_en_aefa-0021 and this module equipped with an intelligent system that receives all the data stores it and allows us to
20130101_20130531_en_aefa-0022 via software and the web all the different parameters in the various environments
20130101_20130531_en_aefa-0023 researchers think that once fully developed platform will allow sport facilities like this one to save up to thirty percent of their energy bills after just five years which is good news for sports facility owners
20130101_20130531_en_aefa-0024 of
20130101_20130531_en_aefa-0025 sensors once distributed in all the different sporting areas will help to optimise my consumption
20130101_20130531_en_aefa-0026 the information i need to consume less energy when there
20130101_20130531_en_aefa-0027 the facilities or to increase the energy use during the peak hours
20130101_20130531_en_aefa-0028 researchers also expect the to contribute to reducing up to
20130101_20130531_en_aefa-0029 of two emissions from sports facilities
20130101_20130531_en_aefb-0001 of
20130101_20130531_en_aefb-0002 two teachers are
20130101_20130531_en_aefb-0003 the
20130101_20130531_en_aefb-0004 of decades of industrial pollution in the river
20130101_20130531_en_aefb-0005 one of the most polluted towns in europe
20130101_20130531_en_aefb-0006 many people would like problems of pollution to be solved often expect the next generation to them are young ready to take on these expectations
20130101_20130531_en_aefb-0007 the best way to protect the environment is to make it a practical part of daily life
20130101_20130531_en_aefb-0008 the kindergarten in
20130101_20130531_en_aefb-0009 poland most activities have a green dimension
20130101_20130531_en_aefb-0010 belong to a group of people who can influence children on question it is up to us to spread this knowledge to them because sometime in the future it could be too late for that
20130101_20130531_en_aefb-0011 will be drowned in waste and that will be the end of
20130101_20130531_en_aefb-0012 recycling is a top priority of the kindergarten every year each european generates over five hundred of
20130101_20130531_en_aefb-0013 waste more than one third of which goes directly to landfill there has been some progress in poland between two thousand one and two thousand ten the country has had the biggest reduction in waste sent to landfill among the twenty-seven states
20130101_20130531_en_aefb-0014 really aware of the results of working with the children i watch them in every day situations for example when they were washing their hands used a lot of water not paying attention to their anti environmental behaviour
20130101_20130531_en_aefb-0015 now i work with really small children
20130101_20130531_en_aefb-0016 and after a couple of months being here
20130101_20130531_en_aefb-0018 these ecological
20130101_20130531_en_aefb-0019 are developed in partnership with schools from six countries
20130101_20130531_en_aefb-0020 it is supported by the programme an eu scheme that promotes international cooperation between schools
20130101_20130531_en_aefb-0021 the school partners met through the european online platform twinning and developed their partnership as well as the virtual relationship teachers visit each others
20130101_20130531_en_aefb-0022 the
20130101_20130531_en_aefb-0023 so far we have visited a school in turkey and we compared our teaching methods
20130101_20130531_en_aefb-0024 we visited a typically pro ecological school there
20130101_20130531_en_aefb-0025 they have their own gardens where they seed plant and grow their products all year long
20130101_20130531_en_aefb-0026 learn to handle plants and care of them
20130101_20130531_en_aefb-0027 to live in the
20130101_20130531_en_aefb-0028 how respect the
20130101_20130531_en_aefb-0029 and not to shed litter
20130101_20130531_en_aefb-0030 water treatment plant was the biggest
20130101_20130531_en_aefb-0031 in the history of
20130101_20130531_en_aefb-0032 it receives
20130101_20130531_en_aefb-0034 the plant manager of the site organises educational visits for students she has seen changes the attitude of the younger generation
20130101_20130531_en_aefb-0035 i show young people the wastewater treatment plant specially the heart of the station so they see where all the sewer is directed from their houses
20130101_20130531_en_aefb-0036 young people are very interested in all the
20130101_20130531_en_aefb-0037 here what happens where does wastewater flow in and where the outflow
20130101_20130531_en_aefb-0038 very encouraging
20130101_20130531_en_aefb-0039 imagine a world where children would have to wear masks
20130101_20130531_en_aefb-0040 is the
20130101_20130531_en_aefb-0041 and a
20130101_20130531_en_aefb-0042 there is an active involvement of all the
20130101_20130531_en_aefb-0043 staff and it influences children in a tremendously effective way
20130101_20130531_en_aefb-0044 you can see in their behaviour it is a very mature pro ecological attitude i think in the future become a sort of small group of ecologists yes i think for sure

20130101_20130531_en_aefd-0001 the people of gettysburg in the united states are readying themselves for a busy year
20130101_20130531_en_aefd-0003 with a packed roster of battle re enactments and

20130101_20130531_en_aefd-0012 and yet these two
20130101_20130531_en_aefd-0013 seventy words reaffirming democratic
20130101_20130531_en_aefd-0014 of freedom and an end to slavery have since become seared in collective american memory

20130101_20130531_en_aefd-0019 i think there
20130101_20130531_en_aefd-0020 hundreds of things you can learn from this battle
20130101_20130531_en_aefd-0021 you can learn about the costs that it

20130101_20130531_en_aefj-0015 so much for this the first step is very important
20130101_20130531_en_aefj-0016 like

20130101_20130531_en_aefj-0020 first step
20130101_20130531_en_aefj-0021 we understand that
20130101_20130531_en_aefj-0022 all problems
20130101_20130531_en_aefj-0023 with
20130101_20130531_en_aefj-0024 lack of democracy here in ukraine but it is important

20130101_20130531_en_aefj-0032 the days
20130101_20130531_en_aefj-0033 certainly it is very important
20130101_20130531_en_aefj-0034 not only for ukrainian politics but
20130101_20130531_en_aefj-0035 for

20130101_20130531_en_aefk-0006 for she was a force to be defined against
20130101_20130531_en_aefk-0007 but if there is one thing that cuts through all of this
20130101_20130531_en_aefk-0008 one thing that runs through everything she did
20130101_20130531_en_aefk-0009 it was her lion love of this country
20130101_20130531_en_aefk-0010 she was

20130101_20130531_en_aegs-0039 dark matter is made of weakly interacting massive particles and because liquid argon is extremely reactive to particle impacts if matter hit one or two argon particles then because argon can emit light and release electrons when hit other particles scientists should be able to record the phenomenon and therefore prove that dark matter exists

20130101_20130531_en_aejs-0006 in spain happened to him but he is fighting it
20130101_20130531_en_aejs-0007 he lost his job two thousand nine then the home he had near barcelona six years
20130101_20130531_en_aejs-0008 with a bank loan of hundred
20130101_20130531_en_aejs-0009 in eleven the savings had him evicted because he four months behind with his payments
20130101_20130531_en_aejs-0010 since then he and his wife and their three children have been living in a subsidised apartment where the rent is two hundred

20130101_20130531_en_aejs-0013 who has since died he told his son

20130101_20130531_en_aejs-0018 tried to negotiate an agreement with the bank but they refused and went ahead with the eviction
20130101_20130531_en_aejs-0019 so moreno took the bank to the trade with a complaint that it had infringed the abuse clause against his client the conversation he tells us went something like this

20130101_20130531_en_aejs-0026 i skipped straight to the verdict and found

20130101_20130531_en_aejs-0033 fundamentally i did it because of the spanish system evictions
20130101_20130531_en_aejs-0034 which leads us to believe unfair
20130101_20130531_en_aejs-0035 that the consumer cannot adequately defend himself in the face an eviction order
20130101_20130531_en_aejs-0036 fourteen march the european court of justice
20130101_20130531_en_aejs-0037 what are the practical considerations for him having already lost
20130101_20130531_en_aejs-0038 the
20130101_20130531_en_aejs-0039 is going to have to study at the court which received his complaint against the bank if his loan came with abuse clauses or not
20130101_20130531_en_aejs-0040 and whether he was correctly dispossessed and evicted from home
20130101_20130531_en_aejs-0043 and will be obliged to remove clauses conditions which are abusive concerning interest rates and the unguaranteed variable rate clause and contract signing
20130101_20130531_en_aejs-0045 the
20130101_20130531_en_aejs-0046 unguaranteed variable rate clause
20130101_20130531_en_aejs-0047 those are clauses the bank uses to guarantee itself a fixed interest rate on repayment even if interest rates drop
20130101_20130531_en_aejs-0048 even if the euro

20130101_20130531_en_aejs-0057 another point is that as a spanish judge i am very
20130101_20130531_en_aejs-0058 that european tribunal has laid down rules that can be enforced not only in
20130101_20130531_en_aejs-0059 but throughout the
20130101_20130531_en_aejs-0060 i think the european court helps make us all more confident in a europe of solidarity and a in which the interests of consumers are defended

20130101_20130531_en_aeld-0004 this canvas is called
20130101_20130531_en_aeld-0005 a cuban flag with barbed wire
20130101_20130531_en_aeld-0006 the hurricane takes away everything it takes away rice it is real rice the

20130101_20130531_en_aeld-0008 because in our cuba there is an official way
20130101_20130531_en_aeld-0009 and also an unofficial way which just as important as the official way
20130101_20130531_en_aeld-0010 for example the amount of food given each month is not enough
20130101_20130531_en_aeld-0011 and to supplement our needs we buy what we need on the black market
20130101_20130531_en_aeld-0013 a picture which is significant for me
20130101_20130531_en_aeld-0014 these are cuban flags with barbed wire and flowers
20130101_20130531_en_aeld-0015 the flowers represent the good things and the barbed wire the bad
20130101_20130531_en_aeld-0016 so like
20130101_20130531_en_aeld-0017 our country has both good and bad
20130101_20130531_en_aeld-0018 dissenting and patriotic

20130101_20130531_en_aeld-0025 i can live in cuba at the moment like a millionaire in whatever country
20130101_20130531_en_aeld-0026 for example type of work i sell for ten or fifteen euros
20130101_20130531_en_aeld-0027 i have a good market

20130101_20130531_en_aeld-0030 but material things change the reality that
20130101_20130531_en_aeld-0031 reality he paints as potentially explosive in
20130101_20130531_en_aeld-0032 a bomb a time bomb
20130101_20130531_en_aeld-0033 as you can see it is made of nails
20130101_20130531_en_aeld-0034 and the end of the fuse is also made of
20130101_20130531_en_aeld-0035 it is a time bomb
20130101_20130531_en_aeld-0036 which when it explodes will cause an enormous amount of damage

20130101_20130531_en_aelg-0013 more recently the european commission has developed a

20130101_20130531_en_aent-0010 with in the diplomatic community in the military or in the intelligence
20130101_20130531_en_aent-0011 who feels that north korea is going to launch any sort of military attack what they may do is test launch a missile
20130101_20130531_en_aent-0013 in the next few days this new medium range missile the
20130101_20130531_en_aent-0014 because never been tested and to do this around the birthday of founder kim il sung if it fails would be a great embarrassment but north korea has kept everyone guessing and it is predictably unpredictable so no can actually predict what will happen but the chances of war seem extremely
20130101_20130531_en_aent-0015 who is actually running north korea
20130101_20130531_en_aent-0017 the

20130101_20130531_en_aent-0019 little doubt it seems even though he is very young and the sort of things we are hearing about him that is too young he is inexperienced is
20130101_20130531_en_aent-0020 he is diabolical we heard these things his father kim il came power and there lots of predictions of the imminent collapse
20130101_20130531_en_aent-0021 of the regime and of course
20130101_20130531_en_aent-0022 kim il was around for a long time but some say
20130101_20130531_en_aent-0023 behind this crisis and that the main target is japan due to interests on some disputed
20130101_20130531_en_aent-0024 islands would you agree that china is somehow manipulating that that
20130101_20130531_en_aent-0026 perhaps a number of different issues north korea wants attention it wants
20130101_20130531_en_aent-0027 negotiations and recognition from washington it definitely wants to be taken seriously and it would like to have aid whether that aid is coming from washington or seoul and by committing
20130101_20130531_en_aent-0028 and
20130101_20130531_en_aent-0029 keeping a sense of an imminent of
20130101_20130531_en_aent-0030 potentially could cause damage to the economy here in the
20130101_20130531_en_aent-0031 perhaps what north korea is looking for is some sort of concession from the new government of president park
20130101_20130531_en_aent-0032 to
20130101_20130531_en_aent-0033 and resume substantial as a couple of
20130101_20130531_en_aent-0034 did some years ago
20130101_20130531_en_aenu-0001 many questions have opened up in venezuela about its future

20130101_20130531_en_aenu-0004 a professor of statistics at the university of venezuela
20130101_20130531_en_aenu-0006 political analysts
20130101_20130531_en_aenu-0007 the difference in the support the candidates got
20130101_20130531_en_aenu-0008 to around two hundred thirty-five
20130101_20130531_en_aenu-0009 around eighty percent of the electorate of some nineteen million people
20130101_20130531_en_aenu-0012 more than six hundred thirty votes swung to the candidate of the opposition this is unknown in our history of electoral procedures and we have had many
20130101_20130531_en_aenu-0014 this result puts the country at a crossroads for dialogue because the country must get together faced with two comparable forces there is no alternative without losing the great wealth that
20130101_20130531_en_aenu-0015 has peace in the form of democratic debate
20130101_20130531_en_aenu-0016 the opposition candidate
20130101_20130531_en_aenu-0017 has denounced what he says are irregularities on the day of voting and rejected the results demanding complete recount of the ballots by hand is there a realistic possibility to appeal through the electoral tribunal and get a
20130101_20130531_en_aenu-0018 it has happened on other occasions reviewing electoral results is simple to do
20130101_20130531_en_aenu-0019 the process is automatic
20130101_20130531_en_aenu-0023 but do you think that the national electoral commission will admit that there were errors
20130101_20130531_en_aenu-0024 yes they have already done it several times
20130101_20130531_en_aenu-0025 not a problem of being willing or not a question of applying written laws and rules and the electoral statutes
20130101_20130531_en_aenu-0026 reviewing the electoral process is so normal that in the past both candidates have accepted it the candidate of the opposition asked for it and the incumbent who was favoured to win according to the result accepted
20130101_20130531_en_aenu-0027 i imagine that seems strange if one is familiar with the electoral process in venezuela going over the process here is not a rare thing
20130101_20130531_en_aenu-0028 turning to what election has brought out into the open
20130101_20130531_en_aenu-0029 managed to unite a large number of voters around his candidacy he gained nearly seven hundred
20130101_20130531_en_aenu-0031 yes i believe so
20130101_20130531_en_aenu-0032 i believe that we are facing a very close result and that for the good health and political future of venezuela
20130101_20130531_en_aenu-0033 it would better to away any
20130101_20130531_en_aenu-0035 campaigning and the closeness of the result how deeply venezuelans are divided how do you see the future is a reconciliation possible and necessary
20130101_20130531_en_aenu-0036 it inevitable but the campaigning taught us many things
20130101_20130531_en_aenu-0037 among them that we venezuelans can be passionate about politics but not about
20130101_20130531_en_aenu-0038 seen six hundred forty voters change position in the space of barely seven

20130101_20130531_en_aeoy-0023 we are opening ourselves
20130101_20130531_en_aeoy-0024 to a new world
20130101_20130531_en_aeoz-0002 it is part of a wide ranging new financial reform
20130101_20130531_en_aeoz-0003 under which eu banks will to boost the cash reserves they to hold as a cushion against economic shocks the cap
20130101_20130531_en_aeoz-0010 will just raise base salaries to compensate
20130101_20130531_en_aepa-0001 france had cases of illegal horsemeat in beef products than any other eu country
20130101_20130531_en_aepa-0002 forty seven of three hundred fifty-three samples examined contained horse dna a rate of more than thirteen percent in the netherlands by contrast the rate was just one percent of the two hundred eighty-eight samples tested
20130101_20130531_en_aepa-0003 the european wants stiffer sanctions the sanctions already exist what we are trying to propose of course this has to be accepted then everyone is that
20130101_20130531_en_aepa-0004 would be to the economic gain made out of the
20130101_20130531_en_aepa-0005 eu leaders agreed to the three month testing period in february after traces of horsemeat discovered in frozen food products
20130101_20130531_en_aepa-0006 the decision was taken amid fears that criminal
20130101_20130531_en_aepa-0007 are deliberately mislabelling
20130101_20130531_en_aepa-0008 and selling it as beef
20130101_20130531_en_aepb-0003 encourage member states to hand out tougher punishments to offenders
20130101_20130531_en_aepb-0004 including seizing the proceeds from their criminal activities
20130101_20130531_en_aepb-0005 the
20130101_20130531_en_aepb-0006 commissioner for home affairs told
20130101_20130531_en_aepb-0007 she find out why there had been such a delay
20130101_20130531_en_aepb-0008 she said
20130101_20130531_en_aepb-0009 i think it sends a bad signal to the increasing number of trafficking victims
20130101_20130531_en_aepb-0010 the latest available data shows there were nine thousand five hundred and twenty eight victims in ten up from six thousand three hundred and nine in two thousand
20130101_20130531_en_aepb-0011 difficult to get convictions for human trafficking but perhaps it will become easier with this directive there really a common definition agreed upon between eu countries
20130101_20130531_en_aepb-0012 eu directives are pieces of legislation that set down clear goals for member states to achieve
20130101_20130531_en_aepb-0013 but how
20130101_20130531_en_aepb-0014 about achieving those goals is up to them
20130101_20130531_en_aepc-0002 the mouse of the future
20130101_20130531_en_aepc-0003 enter the space coder
20130101_20130531_en_aepc-0004 three
20130101_20130531_en_aepc-0005 three d designers
20130101_20130531_en_aepc-0006 a precise easy to use tool for contact free three d drawing
20130101_20130531_en_aepc-0007 however the space coder a black box is more than just a three d mouse it uses a system based on light shadow to read the three d position of a light source to the precision of and
20130101_20130531_en_aepc-0008 we can also use the space coder to move an object in three dimensions and change the angle to turn it the way we want in a very precise way
20130101_20130531_en_aepc-0009 we can also use the space coder like a remote control one button will suffice to navigate the different menus
20130101_20130531_en_aepc-0010 the space coder is based on the principle of shadow imaging
20130101_20130531_en_aepc-0011 imagine that a blank piece of is a vision sensor such as a
20130101_20130531_en_aepc-0012 if i place my hand at a fixed distance from the sensor variations in the position of the light source are detected by the space coder
20130101_20130531_en_aepc-0013 the projected shadow when analysed by the sensor allows the three d position of light source to detected when you move moves you it closer or further away it grows or gets smaller
20130101_20130531_en_aepc-0014 the principle very simple really based on chinese shadow puppets and shadow imaging
20130101_20130531_en_aepc-0015 power is another application which uses the space coder thanks to little light on the pedal which is measured by the space coder at
20130101_20130531_en_aepc-0016 level sportsmen and women can track their performance in real time
20130101_20130531_en_aepc-0017 can be used by amateurs or elite athletes
20130101_20130531_en_aepc-0018 despite the dreadful weather scientists are using this tool called sun tracker which is able to determine with absolute precision the angle of the sun relative to the earth
20130101_20130531_en_aepc-0019 sun tracker is another space coder application as it detects the three d position of any light source with high
20130101_20130531_en_aepc-0020 it can calculate precisely the position of the sun
20130101_20130531_en_aepc-0021 detects a new sun position every ten minutes with an angular precision of two hundred fifty micro degrees
20130101_20130531_en_aepc-0022 such extreme performance is necessary for demanding
20130101_20130531_en_aepc-0023 applications like tracking the sun or stars
20130101_20130531_en_aepc-0024 or airplanes
20130101_20130531_en_aepc-0025 with for biomedical engineering
20130101_20130531_en_aepc-0026 the space coder will be in image guided
20130101_20130531_en_aepc-0027 for implanting hearing aids
20130101_20130531_en_aepc-0028 the surgery consists of drilling a minimally invasive tunnel behind the ear to pass the electrode implant directly into the cochlea
20130101_20130531_en_aepc-0029 the
20130101_20130531_en_aepc-0030 other technologies use a stereo camera which is a lot bigger and a lot more expensive and less precise
20130101_20130531_en_aepc-0032 the robotic arm and the drill bit to make the tunnel
20130101_20130531_en_aepc-0033 to get to
20130101_20130531_en_aepc-0034 the cochlea
20130101_20130531_en_aepc-0035 this where the accuracy and precision of space coder is very important the space is very small

20130101_20130531_en_aepe-0004 president obama made this statement
20130101_20130531_en_aepe-0005 directed the full resources the government to help state and
20130101_20130531_en_aepe-0006 people

20130101_20130531_en_aepe-0013 the attacks on the world trade centre and the pentagon happened twelve years
20130101_20130531_en_aepe-0014 nine saw three
20130101_20130531_en_aepe-0015 lives lost staggering the nation
20130101_20130531_en_aepe-0016 was the worst death toll to terrorism the united states has ever suffered at foreign hands islamist enemies
20130101_20130531_en_aepe-0017 but the us has also been attacked from within six years before nine eleven far right militant and us citizen timothy mcveigh set off a truck packed with explosives in front of a federal government building in oklahoma city killing hundred sixty-eight people and wounding than five hundred
20130101_20130531_en_aepe-0018 the same movement killed two and wounded hundred twelve one year later at the
20130101_20130531_en_aepe-0020 in
20130101_20130531_en_aepe-0023 well mark this is a very very strange atmosphere on the one hand the city is still under shock but on the other hand as you can see around me
20130101_20130531_en_aepe-0024 are signs of what appears to be normal
20130101_20130531_en_aepe-0025 there are still most of the runners here in boston i have spoken to some of the european runners were there yesterday they said they are still sticking to their plans
20130101_20130531_en_aepe-0026 stay here until the weekend
20130101_20130531_en_aepe-0027 the of their stay here boston so
20130101_20130531_en_aepe-0028 very very mixed
20130101_20130531_en_aepe-0029 in boston right now
20130101_20130531_en_aepe-0030 the fbi and the head of homeland security have spoken they say they have no
20130101_20130531_en_aepe-0032 what do we know
20130101_20130531_en_aepe-0033 authorities here are really at the absolute starting point
20130101_20130531_en_aepe-0034 now
20130101_20130531_en_aepe-0035 a lot of various
20130101_20130531_en_aepe-0036 issues here are
20130101_20130531_en_aepe-0037 video
20130101_20130531_en_aepe-0038 cameras are checking
20130101_20130531_en_aepe-0039 photographs they are checking videos privately taken videos
20130101_20130531_en_aepe-0040 they are doing a things but so far there is no clear
20130101_20130531_en_aepe-0041 here
20130101_20130531_en_aepe-0042 president obama yesterday warned against jumping conclusions
20130101_20130531_en_aepe-0043 many americans
20130101_20130531_en_aepe-0044 understandably will
20130101_20130531_en_aepe-0045 what you think is more frightening for americans
20130101_20130531_en_aepe-0046 or a foreign threat
20130101_20130531_en_aepe-0047 this is the fifty million dollar question
20130101_20130531_en_aepe-0048 it is absolutely
20130101_20130531_en_aepe-0049 difficult to what is more for americans is it another al qaeda related attack is it home grown a
20130101_20130531_en_aepe-0050 made attack by an american terrorist
20130101_20130531_en_aepe-0051 what comes to mind of course is the oklahoma city bombing back in ninety-five which came as a big shock to americans on the other hand
20130101_20130531_en_aepe-0052 we all know the tragedy of nine eleven and americans have
20130101_20130531_en_aepe-0053 these days were that for more than ten years there has been some sort of
20130101_20130531_en_aepe-0054 normalcy you know a creeping into their lives after the fear after the tragedy and now they are
20130101_20130531_en_aepe-0056 what americans wish a foreign or a domestic attack
20130101_20130531_en_aepe-0058 thank you mark
20130101_20130531_en_aepf-0001 marathon
20130101_20130531_en_aepf-0002 bomb attacks near the finish line three people and wounded more than
20130101_20130531_en_aepf-0003 of
20130101_20130531_en_aepf-0004 london
20130101_20130531_en_aepf-0005 as
20130101_20130531_en_aepf-0006 and
20130101_20130531_en_aepf-0007 president of the tokyo marathon expressed his sadness the the
20130101_20130531_en_aepf-0008 but insisted the bombings would not deter people especially the japanese from running in overseas events
20130101_20130531_en_aepf-0010 will remain the same and we will continue participate marathons overseas
20130101_20130531_en_aepf-0011 marathon officials across the globe will gather in london next week for the world marathon majors meeting where security most certainly now be top of the
20130101_20130531_en_aepg-0002 the time the warning went out three hundred eighty people had bought some notably in germany france and spain
20130101_20130531_en_aepg-0003 they were contacted and told
20130101_20130531_en_aepg-0004 in the same company had been accused by the public authorities of the same thing mixing dutch and irish horse meat and
20130101_20130531_en_aepg-0005 the product was sold as straight beef
20130101_20130531_en_aepg-0006 and it was possible that some of it remained in frozen supermarket foods
20130101_20130531_en_aepg-0008 meat scandal suspected of selling horse as beef for use in ready
20130101_20130531_en_aepg-0009 the french company blamed its supplier saying labelling was switched
20130101_20130531_en_aepg-0011 the modern plant employs three hundred people and exports around eighty tonnes of horse meat each year to a dozen countries in europe
20130101_20130531_en_aepg-0012 the director no incorrect or altered labels were put on
20130101_20130531_en_aepg-0013 it must been relabelled somewhere maybe in france but certainly not in romania
20130101_20130531_en_aepg-0014 each truck leaving here is gps tracked monitored for speed the stops made and temperature inside everything is monitored
20130101_20130531_en_aepg-0015 a lot of in europe has been required by since ninety-three with food goods among those allowed to move across border freely so that if trouble came the would be able pull a product off the market necessary
20130101_20130531_en_aepg-0016 been happening in this scandal is fraud rather than a health scare when the ie restaurant in prague found it was serving horsemeat to its customers in error
20130101_20130531_en_aepg-0017 czech authorities got involved
20130101_20130531_en_aepg-0018 said according to information we have
20130101_20130531_en_aeph-0001 president obama has described the bombing of the boston marathon as an act of terrorism in a short briefing from the house the president praised the efforts of the
20130101_20130531_en_aeph-0002 services the people of
20130101_20130531_en_aeph-0003 and the exhausted runners who had the energy presence of mind to assist the injured
20130101_20130531_en_aeph-0004 this was a heinous and cowardly act
20130101_20130531_en_aeph-0005 given what we
20130101_20130531_en_aeph-0006 what took place the fbi is investigating an act of terrorism
20130101_20130531_en_aeph-0008 is who carried out attack
20130101_20130531_en_aeph-0009 or why
20130101_20130531_en_aeph-0010 whether was planned executed by a terrorist organisation foreign or domestic
20130101_20130531_en_aeph-0011 or the act of

20130101_20130531_en_aepi-0002 the smooth conclusion of the agreement we can deliver a message of optimism but not to relax until greece can re enter the markets the road is rocky

20130101_20130531_en_aepj-0003 the the
20130101_20130531_en_aepj-0005 before second bomb
20130101_20130531_en_aepj-0006 and never forget that that was going on during that time
20130101_20130531_en_aepj-0007 the
20130101_20130531_en_aepj-0008 security has been stepped up in washington and new york
20130101_20130531_en_aepj-0009 and boston is still on high alert for now americans are beginning to mourn the worst attack on their soil since nine eleven
20130101_20130531_en_aepk-0001 authorities in boston have held a briefing on the latest developments in the aftermath of the bombing of the boston marathon the number of injured stands at one hundred seventy-six seventeen
20130101_20130531_en_aepk-0002 in a critical condition three people were killed and
20130101_20130531_en_aepk-0003 in planting the devices

20130101_20130531_en_aepk-0006 in the area of the blast have been examined there are no unexploded bombs the fbi
20130101_20130531_en_aepk-0007 investigation and called on the public to cooperate
20130101_20130531_en_aepk-0008 a prayer
20130101_20130531_en_aepk-0009 for the victims is to go ahead in the city tomorrow to date no one
20130101_20130531_en_aepk-0010 and no group or individual has claimed responsibility
20130101_20130531_en_aepl-0001 harsh rhetoric from north korea is nothing new but some observers in the us feel that the recent threats
20130101_20130531_en_aepl-0002 real danger this time others claim they reflect the changing internal dynamics and new leadership in pyongyang and that this crisis will pass
20130101_20130531_en_aepl-0003 either way us policy experts agree that
20130101_20130531_en_aepl-0004 must be ready
20130101_20130531_en_aepl-0005 to me the biggest takeaway this
20130101_20130531_en_aepl-0006 is it tells us very
20130101_20130531_en_aepl-0007 that a
20130101_20130531_en_aepl-0008 armed missile capable korea
20130101_20130531_en_aepl-0009 if they have those capabilities at some point down the
20130101_20130531_en_aepl-0010 could have
20130101_20130531_en_aepl-0011 to actually carry out
20130101_20130531_en_aepl-0012 blood curdling that have heard that is a worrisome thing to me
20130101_20130531_en_aepl-0013 other experts the
20130101_20130531_en_aepl-0014 north korea
20130101_20130531_en_aepl-0015 been over exaggerated
20130101_20130531_en_aepl-0017 operational but they have never test flown it nobody in united states in russia in europe would
20130101_20130531_en_aepl-0018 consider a missile never flown once as an operational system
20130101_20130531_en_aepl-0020 the white house afford to underestimate pyongyang
20130101_20130531_en_aepl-0021 states is in a dilemma secretary of state john kerry has expressed the american willingness to re engage with north korea the problem is the north koreans want this conversation only on their terms and that is being accepted as a
20130101_20130531_en_aepl-0022 weapon state
20130101_20130531_en_aepl-0023 and without a major role for south korea
20130101_20130531_en_aepm-0001 north korea has fired off new threats to south korea vowing sledge hammer blows of retaliation
20130101_20130531_en_aepm-0002 the anger was sparked by reported anti north korean protests in the south on monday as their neighbours celebrated the birth of its founding leader
20130101_20130531_en_aepm-0003 despite the new ultimatum a senior us military official in south korea believed the north korean leadership was looking for way to cool down its rhetoric after weeks of warnings of war
20130101_20130531_en_aepm-0004 south korea reacted to the threat with a foreign ministry spokesman
20130101_20130531_en_aepm-0005 it was not worth a
20130101_20130531_en_aepm-0006 and was waiting for the north to make a wise decision
20130101_20130531_en_aepm-0007 last week seoul offered talks with their neighbours but the overture was rejected as a cunning ploy
20130101_20130531_en_aepm-0008 analysts believe diplomatic war of words have taken a softer

20130101_20130531_en_aepy-0007 and that can be achieved through a re orientation of the priorities of europe
20130101_20130531_en_aepy-0008 if the european commission likes the fiscal plans paris will get more time to meet the three percent deficit target but the latest international monetary fund forecast sees the french economy contracting by
20130101_20130531_en_aepy-0009 this year which would make that target much more difficult to reach particularly as more cuts hit consumers

20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0004 and
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0005 to what extent does economic crisis affect the international art market
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0006 the economic crisis is affecting international art market like all sectors in a relative or differentiated way because art market has special characteristics
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0007 this market is surprising a market where there are only individuals individual collectors and individual objects
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0008 very special characteristics and therefore faced with a crisis we that masterpieces rare works with a prestigious provenance paintings are not affected by the
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0009 on the contrary they are more sought after by big collectors
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0010 in contrast objects of lesser value interesting paintings but of less marked value can be affected by the crisis and their estimates should at this point extremely precise to enable us to sell them
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0011 so the crisis has a differentiated impact depending on the quality and importance of the object
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0012 there have been some auctions where works reach incredible prices is art always a good investment or is the risk of a bubble effect
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0014 works of picasso sold at auction in paris for example a portrait of dora maar went for seven million euros
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0015 true that these figures suggest that the art market is a somewhat protected area a safe haven in times
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0016 the reality is more nuanced of course because again there are areas where there fewer buyers and worries about the global economic situation may be
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0017 the art market increasingly reserved for the elites the very rich
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0018 what kind of artwork is the most prized by your clients
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0019 the twentieth century art is undeniably the largest on the market today
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0020 impressionism modern art the art of the postwar period in these the highest prices made
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0021 some other sectors have experienced in recent years a very rapid development such as the of africa and
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0022 which become a very important sector of the market
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0023 another area that seen a dramatic development is asian art only a dozen years ago the art market was a reserved primarily for western clients europeans and americans
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0024 in recent asian buyers including the chinese came to the market a huge appetite for buying works of their history imperial works seals jades and ceramics
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0025 and we have seen this market also develop very quickly
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0026 your customers is their profiles changing
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0027 the identity of the buyers the profile of the buyers in the art market has evolved in recent years a dozen years ago the typical profile of the collector was a western one a european an american
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0028 today the typical profile is difficult to say because there are buyers from russia china india and america who have increased the number of potential customers on top of the americans and europeans who still there
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0029 the profile is more difficult to draw
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0030 in addition secondary sectors have highly developed in recent years take for example photography or the art of africa
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0031 which have experienced a very rapid development
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0032 led to an
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0033 of new buyers younger a different from what we had in the more traditional sectors ten years ago
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0034 is
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0035 paris still attractive to collectors
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0036 france were years ago the main art market in the world
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0037 it was a time when france paris were still from the point of view of creativity and the density of artists a must
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0038 and then there were extremely important auction houses and dealers that dominated the world at a time when the art market was still relatively small
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0039 it was a coexistence of national markets and throughout the eighties nineties and since two thousand the market became international
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0040 france has ground
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0041 in this
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0042 often like to have a little protectionist reflex france always a little
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0043 globalisation and we lost ground
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0044 as the process of globalisation grew france lost its top spot
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0045 the action moved to countries and sales places that are dynamic to attract buyers and create large events around sales
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0046 london new york obviously as as now hong kong which become an extremely
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0047 sales point
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0049 the art market highly sensitive to taxation and regulations
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0050 for a very simple reason
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0051 objects that are sold on the art market as well the collectors involved in the art market are mobile
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0052 an object can be sold in paris but its owner can also decide to sell it very easily in london or geneva
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0053 a collector can choose to buy at an auction in paris but can also buy in london geneva or new york today with international technology the internet sending catalogues communications made by auction houses
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0054 which provide information at home anywhere in the world
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0055 the taxation from this point of view is decisive because it may cause a
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0056 these actors or their preferences to sell a work of
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0057 what are your predictions
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0058 and the coming years what in recent years that after a period of very rapid development in the two
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0059 we had like other sectors a crisis in two thousand eight two thousand nine crisis of confidence and so the market shrank we rebounded strongly developed well in ten eleven
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0060 eleven was very good
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0061 was a little down and thirteen watching carefully because i think there are risk factors we must be cautious in estimating the that are on sale because the horizon of all the economic operators but also our customers is under scrutiny people are not making long term plans they see that this year is undeniably difficult at a european level so they are cautious our role this context is to adapt ourselves by making extremely attractive estimations to generate trust

20130101_20130531_en_aeux-0074 come
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0001 giorgio napolitano has been sworn in as italian president in parliament the second seven mandate for the head of state
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0002 who will turn eighty-eight in june
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0003 his continuation in office comes from the political crisis born of the recent elections
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0006 italy is still in a political impasse months after it held legislative elections
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0007 its institutional stalemate is the product of the seemingly unsolvable puzzle of the february ballot
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0009 party silvio
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0010 centre right and the five star movement of beppe grillo
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0014 in the we will vote against giving the democratic party our
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0018 some of its members did
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0019 he said we have to explain
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0024 it was impossible eighty-seven year old giorgio napolitano nearing the end of his term as president of the republic to call fresh elections to try to unblock the logjam and so italy was in an institutional paralysis as it sank further into the economic mud
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0025 in a joint session of the chamber of deputies and the senate along with special regional electors it took six rounds of voting for the political blocs to produce a
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0027 napolitano agreed to serve for another seven years
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0028 he now has the power to dissolve parliament
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0031 bologna
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0033 in return however napolitano has asked the parties to hold themselves accountable italians are wondering how these politicians can possibly keep such a promise given that in recent months the image they have presented has been so bad
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0034 in your opinion how long will it take before the parties start fighting again
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0036 i think they allow the new government at least one year in which to do several much needed things
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0037 first reform the electoral system
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0038 and second to
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0040 because these reforms have been negotiated with the eu
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0042 only then may the parties decide if they want to resume fighting or maybe build something new
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0045 the message is remember we have an excellent president of the republic with a high international standing a man you can
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0046 either english or french
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0047 who represents very well a country that has a lot of problems to solve here he is please your
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0048 in us and i the markets have already answered in a positive way
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0049 at moment the favourite as prime minister seems to be giuliano amato do you think that amato in the coming months will be able to carry out both the institutional and
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0050 reforms necessary for the country
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0052 standing
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0053 amato has an international profile he is fluent in english and he is a treasury minister
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0055 not only an
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0056 on legal matters he also has an extensive knowledge economic issues
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0058 otherwise we risk huge delay a failure to fulfil commitments and that could accentuate speculation against italy by the markets
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0061 government in any country even in the most efficient democracies can carry long term projects if it allowed survive for less than a year the problem is we need to rebuild our country
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0062 that is impossible in one year
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0063 but in that time we can make progress on some of the guidelines which are already there which have been wisely outlined for italy by the european commission
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0064 we can pull ourselves together this can be done all the rest will depend obviously on the approval the government manages to earn and its ability to accomplish tasks but also on the backing the different parties will to grant amato

20130101_20130531_en_aeuz-0010 the european automobile market is down by twenty five percent between two thousand seven and twelve that represents four million fewer cars being bought by customers in europe and we really see no signs that us hope of a rebound
20130101_20130531_en_aeuz-0011 this year we think the market will drop by around five percent and see no signs of a rebound this year or next year including in germany
20130101_20130531_en_aeuz-0012 do those poor sales figures for march in europe mean that peugeot will have to consider more job losses at its plants on top of those that have already been announced
20130101_20130531_en_aeuz-0014 way possible when it comes to issues having made a commitment that we will help every single one of our workers facing problems with employment
20130101_20130531_en_aeuz-0016 that forces that decision on us
20130101_20130531_en_aeuz-0018 and
20130101_20130531_en_aeuz-0019 internationalisation or going upmarket or both
20130101_20130531_en_aeuz-0020 yes i believe that internationalisation and producing more upscale models are the two keys to success
20130101_20130531_en_aeuz-0021 the first will make us less dependent on europe and increase our presence in growth markets and where car sales are growing

20130101_20130531_en_aewj-0023 there have been amazing encounters between people who may not otherwise have spoken to
20130101_20130531_en_aewj-0024 say the

20130101_20130531_en_aewj-0026 the verbal fight against homophobia but has also been practically active by introducing people
20130101_20130531_en_aewj-0027 but there have violent clashes
20130101_20130531_en_aewj-0028 rights
20130101_20130531_en_aewj-0030 even if flagship social reform law becomes
20130101_20130531_en_aewj-0031 its opponents have said they will not give
20130101_20130531_en_aewj-0033 the author of demanding gay marriage in belgium france and spain a comparative study of movements in these three countries
20130101_20130531_en_aewj-0036 yes it is a surprise and when the draft law was presented in
20130101_20130531_en_aewj-0037 the
20130101_20130531_en_aewj-0039 but we in the
20130101_20130531_en_aewj-0040 that the dynamic was both against the president and paradoxically even before the debates got started the dynamic related to old divisions in french society like the question of the republic or secularity which have never been accepted by some groups
20130101_20130531_en_aewj-0041 france one of the pioneers on the subject with homosexual relations decriminalised in
20130101_20130531_en_aewj-0042 ninety-one during the revolution while in some countries in europe evolution would only come around in the twenty th century
20130101_20130531_en_aewj-0043 there was a paradoxical effect in that the movement for homosexual rights down in the countries that
20130101_20130531_en_aewj-0044 it
20130101_20130531_en_aewj-0045 movements became much than in countries like england or germany and therefore demands grew weaker
20130101_20130531_en_aewj-0046 so catholic countries with more practicing catholics than in france
20130101_20130531_en_aewj-0047 or
20130101_20130531_en_aewj-0051 absolutely and that is stronger in france than in other countries the worry over what could happen to children raised by parents of the same sex but also a broader worry about who can be a parent and family be created not revolves around the definition of the family the definition of affiliation
20130101_20130531_en_aewj-0052 why is it stronger in
20130101_20130531_en_aewj-0054 a lot of people have tried to work on that researchers looking into these questions have sought explain how certain knowledge has been built up how france has a ballast of catholic thinking which on the other has been mixed with a sort of psychoanalysis and a certain anthropology which have stressed these notions which may have created more intellectual barriers to moving rights along than in other
20130101_20130531_en_aewj-0056 more rights or visibility in society they get very defensive
20130101_20130531_en_aewj-0057 this reaction a latent rejection that we have trouble admitting to
20130101_20130531_en_aewj-0060 civil union which people today seem ready to accept including accepting improvements in the civil union in order to refuse outright marriage
20130101_20130531_en_aewj-0061 problem is marriage and i think the main beyond homosexuality for most of the opponents is really to know what model of family is created in society

20130101_20130531_en_afad-0010 and how the songs are constructed that sometimes gets a bit missed and i think that doing an acoustic show really exposes that
20130101_20130531_en_afad-0011 and that delicacy and that vulnerability and really exposes us as musicians you know
20130101_20130531_en_afad-0012 we can see how good we really are

20130101_20130531_en_afad-0018 the industry seems
20130101_20130531_en_afad-0019 to be

20130101_20130531_en_afae-0009 particularly low then there should be consideration
20130101_20130531_en_afae-0010 to adjusting by way of slowing the pace
20130101_20130531_en_afae-0011 for
20130101_20130531_en_afae-0013 in line with this policy

20130101_20130531_en_afae-0035 would lead to less
20130101_20130531_en_afae-0036 and the european economy would grow again
20130101_20130531_en_afae-0038 of a european transfer union
20130101_20130531_en_afae-0039 not at all
20130101_20130531_en_afae-0040 first we have to say that the responsibility for a change of direction must be with the countries that to pursue austerity
20130101_20130531_en_afae-0041 they made mistakes and they have to tell their
20130101_20130531_en_afae-0043 they have to solve the problem with europe providing assistance

20130101_20130531_en_afae-0055 certainly it would be better if there were more money investment in the southern countries

20130101_20130531_en_afag-0002 in budapest last year when the hungarian capital was
20130101_20130531_en_afag-0003 by a demonstration by the extreme right

20130101_20130531_en_afag-0012 in the past
20130101_20130531_en_afag-0013 was a bit
20130101_20130531_en_afag-0016 directly
20130101_20130531_en_afag-0018 hungarian jews who perished in the holocaust in world war two
20130101_20130531_en_afag-0019 it is one of the reasons why the world jewish
20130101_20130531_en_afag-0020 plenary session normally held in israel is coming to budapest this year
20130101_20130531_en_afag-0022 this is on top of a rising number of regular attacks against roma peoples
20130101_20130531_en_afag-0023 the
20130101_20130531_en_afag-0025 one of its leaders made the headlines last winter he called for a list to be made of members of parliament the government and civil service who were jewish and could represent a threat to national security
20130101_20130531_en_afag-0026 public outrage followed
20130101_20130531_en_afag-0027 he retorted by claiming he anti semitic and was only looking at double nationality issues
20130101_20130531_en_afag-0028 any citizen of a country completely disregards international law
20130101_20130531_en_afag-0029 and commits genocide
20130101_20130531_en_afag-0030 twenty-four hours a day against the palestinian people means a national security risk anywhere in any country that they go to
20130101_20130531_en_afag-0031 this the reason why
20130101_20130531_en_afag-0032 hungarian citizenship is of
20130101_20130531_en_afag-0033 particular interest
20130101_20130531_en_afag-0034 to us and also because shimon peres the president of israel back in two thousand seven
20130101_20130531_en_afag-0035 talked about my country hungary
20130101_20130531_en_afag-0036 as the

20130101_20130531_en_afag-0038 israeli jewish
20130101_20130531_en_afag-0039 and financial people and this was all
20130101_20130531_en_afag-0040 in the
20130101_20130531_en_afag-0041 of colonisation and building empires
20130101_20130531_en_afag-0042 this is an embarrassment for the hungarian government when it is trying to strengthen good relations with israel
20130101_20130531_en_afag-0043 beyond political considerations measures to combat racism and anti semitism will be reinforced promises hungarian parliament
20130101_20130531_en_afag-0044 where new house rules have
20130101_20130531_en_afag-0045 recently we reinforced our position on hate speech through fourth amendment of the constitution
20130101_20130531_en_afag-0046 with these changes we can silence any mp whose speech harms the dignity of the parliament or can hurt other people or groups of people
20130101_20130531_en_afag-0047 we can also expel them from a session and the measure can be a financial penalty

20130101_20130531_en_afag-0052 where he is the subject of frequent attacks
20130101_20130531_en_afag-0053 the commentaries were extremely aggressive including the regret that
20130101_20130531_en_afag-0054 the job of auschwitz was not finished and things like this the truth is that my feeling of security has disappeared
20130101_20130531_en_afag-0056 for the director of the federation of hungarian jewish communities the country still needs to come to terms with its history before mentalities can change
20130101_20130531_en_afag-0057 in germany people are confronted with their past not
20130101_20130531_en_afag-0059 recent recommendations from the education ministry for example adding known for their anti semitism during war to the school syllabus sparked
20130101_20130531_en_afag-0060 it was a suggestion not an obligation
20130101_20130531_en_afag-0061 but the director of budapest school that make the decision neutral
20130101_20130531_en_afag-0062 when the education secretary presented her new programme she stated one objective was to reinforce national identity we can clearly say these authors are not major ones and for this reason we can imagine their inclusion is for political and ideological reasons
20130101_20130531_en_afag-0063 another novelty is the introduction next year of religious education classes at state schools
20130101_20130531_en_afag-0064 as an option they can be replaced classes in ethics

20130101_20130531_en_afct-0004 public
20130101_20130531_en_afct-0005 can often be at the heart of the problem
20130101_20130531_en_afct-0006 to prove who we are

20130101_20130531_en_afed-0039 to be perceived
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0040 i think will
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0041 see a monarchy with
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0042 communication
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0043 much more visits to the population

20130101_20130531_en_afed-0047 the media
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0048 i think will see a
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0049 change now
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0050 into the twenty-first century also
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0051 the role of the
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0052 it
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0054 as a matter of
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0055 only last year the queen was thrown out of forming the new government which she used to
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0056 and now
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0057 parliament did it itself
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0058 king is still member of government
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0059 he signs all the laws and all the measures but this could
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0060 if
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0061 parliament wants this to change no problem
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0062 he could end up as
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0063 national master of ceremonies only and not a political factor
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0064 the netherlands
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0065 divided country the
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0066 has been debate
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0067 as a strong symbol the ability to bridge those gaps
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0068 of the problems in the netherlands the last
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0069 is that the
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0070 in favour of european cooperation
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0071 aid to
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0072 world countries while a lot of politicians against
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0073 the big question now
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0074 does
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0075 to his
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0076 but how can he do so if
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0077 not really relevant any more
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0078 well of course has a of moral role in society for example his mother queen beatrix had
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0079 television interview
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0080 in which she gave her views on europe
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0081 on tolerance in society not all politicians liked what she was doing but
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0082 i hope the new king will do it as well
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0083 all over europe have to struggle every now and then
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0084 how is the dutch perceived
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0085 they are
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0086 most people support the monarchy
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0087 a strange kind of monarchy
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0088 in reality we are
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0089 republic with someone with a crown
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0090 we have a lot of republican features as well there were debates on the house
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0091 wanted to buy in mozambique near to some millionaires like the of pret a
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0092 jet set people
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0093 and end the government
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0095 roots
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0096 going through the of
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0097 there
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0098 the wages they get planes they use and i think politicians
20130101_20130531_en_afed-0099 want them to have more sober life than led during the last centuries
20130101_20130531_en_afee-0001 wisdom sometimes lies in knowing when to let someone else take over the house of orange has applied it time and again
20130101_20130531_en_afee-0002 queen beatrix having said that only by wanting to serve could modern royalty make sense bows for her son just as her mother made for her and her grandmother handed over to her mother
20130101_20130531_en_afee-0003 beatrix is getting out when she is seventy-five willem alexander has just turned forty-six since eighty-three the rule in the is one of absolute
20130101_20130531_en_afee-0004 inheritance by the eldest offspring male or female
20130101_20130531_en_afee-0005 this relatively modern less traditionally rigid approach to passing the crown along less misogynist matched in flexibility by the business of thinking of abdication as natural as well that thinking is still the exception in western europe which has seven kingdoms one duchy and two principalities all of them hereditary constitutional monarchies
20130101_20130531_en_afee-0006 elizabeth

20130101_20130531_en_afgt-0044 the
20130101_20130531_en_afgt-0045 also
20130101_20130531_en_afgt-0046 the same
20130101_20130531_en_afgt-0047 very
20130101_20130531_en_afgt-0048 and it is unbelievable to see

20130101_20130531_en_afgt-0053 the
20130101_20130531_en_afgt-0054 is
20130101_20130531_en_afgt-0055 and are able to for example
20130101_20130531_en_afgt-0056 million euros
20130101_20130531_en_afgt-0057 a
20130101_20130531_en_afgt-0058 this is main difference
20130101_20130531_en_afgt-0059 the german team has improved its of play now we are seeing the same at club level are there any parallels
20130101_20130531_en_afgt-0060 of course it is because young players in germany already able to play at the highest
20130101_20130531_en_afgt-0061 largely

20130101_20130531_en_afgt-0065 choose them anymore but still has other top
20130101_20130531_en_afgt-0066 a
20130101_20130531_en_afgt-0068 for sure
20130101_20130531_en_afgt-0069 the
20130101_20130531_en_afgt-0070 very
20130101_20130531_en_afgt-0071 overtook italy
20130101_20130531_en_afgt-0072 of course it will depend on in the
20130101_20130531_en_afgt-0073 we are on the
20130101_20130531_en_afgt-0074 overtaking as
20130101_20130531_en_afgt-0075 the
20130101_20130531_en_afgt-0076 is
20130101_20130531_en_afgt-0077 now
20130101_20130531_en_afgt-0078 german
20130101_20130531_en_afgt-0079 benefits
20130101_20130531_en_afgt-0080 munich and borussia dortmund easily qualified for next champions league can we expect similar to this season
20130101_20130531_en_afgt-0081 it
20130101_20130531_en_afgt-0082 is
20130101_20130531_en_afgt-0083 to the of
20130101_20130531_en_afgt-0084 so maybe we can expect another great
20130101_20130531_en_afgt-0085 as
20130101_20130531_en_afgt-0086 the
20130101_20130531_en_afgt-0087 even the
20130101_20130531_en_afgt-0088 of
20130101_20130531_en_afgt-0089 it is impressive to see the
20130101_20130531_en_afgt-0090 today

20130101_20130531_en_afgt-0092 even though they have
20130101_20130531_en_afgt-0093 the last years
20130101_20130531_en_afgt-0095 the
20130101_20130531_en_afgt-0096 final
20130101_20130531_en_afgt-0097 can only
20130101_20130531_en_afgt-0098 in general

20130101_20130531_en_afkx-0003 under the proposal all future testing of food will be mandatory and conducted without any prior warning
20130101_20130531_en_afkx-0004 the legislation we are now proposing as commission is that official
20130101_20130531_en_afkx-0005 should always be unannounced in order to strengthen our tools to fight

20130101_20130531_en_afky-0002 at the
20130101_20130531_en_afky-0005 to create robots that can mimic humans closely as possible to do that we need to understand basic human locomotion and based on this data gathered here we can design new robots this
20130101_20130531_en_afky-0006 european union research project gathered experts neuroscience biology and robotics from five countries
20130101_20130531_en_afky-0007 studying volunteers and animals
20130101_20130531_en_afky-0008 built a computer database that serves as a reference for robotic engineers
20130101_20130531_en_afky-0009 we use the motion capture system and it works with reflective markers on the skin of the animal or the human
20130101_20130531_en_afky-0010 the flash infrared light with a frequency of two hundred fifty
20130101_20130531_en_afky-0011 this gets reflected by the markers and recorded the software then a three d model
20130101_20130531_en_afky-0012 researchers want to better understand the transition between walking upright and running on all fours this should help to make robots that can move one way or depending on the environment

20130101_20130531_en_afky-0014 locomotion of humans and animals evolved over millions of years
20130101_20130531_en_afky-0016 as we can see in robotics so far
20130101_20130531_en_afky-0017 but the more we study humans and animals the we can get to replicating their movements
20130101_20130531_en_afky-0018 robotic engineers test their new models using a specially developed
20130101_20130531_en_afky-0019 construction kit

20130101_20130531_en_afky-0027 have
20130101_20130531_en_afky-0029 so in to get them to really help in
20130101_20130531_en_afky-0030 need to be able to walk in our environment
20130101_20130531_en_afky-0031 we first want to understand the basic functions of human and animal movement but later on this technology may be used to guide the design process more functional prosthesis or orthosis for instance
20130101_20130531_en_afky-0032 may be a journey
20130101_20130531_en_afky-0033 begins with single step
20130101_20130531_en_afkz-0001 every year thousands of asylum seekers arrive in greece in a bid to build lives
20130101_20130531_en_afkz-0002 but the reality greets them is one of unemployment destitution the ever threat of deportation and more recently
20130101_20130531_en_afkz-0003 there are
20130101_20130531_en_afkz-0004 determined to
20130101_20130531_en_afkz-0005 the

20130101_20130531_en_afkz-0010 racism is becoming
20130101_20130531_en_afkz-0011 very popular in greece
20130101_20130531_en_afkz-0012 just see a foreigner and
20130101_20130531_en_afkz-0013 they
20130101_20130531_en_afkz-0015 is
20130101_20130531_en_afkz-0016 so for me is very important
20130101_20130531_en_afkz-0017 make people aware of
20130101_20130531_en_afkz-0018 after arriving in greece in two thousand nine and only recently acquiring his legal status
20130101_20130531_en_afkz-0019 from iran also campaigns for change he recognises the new culture of fear the situation is
20130101_20130531_en_afkz-0020 scary

20130101_20130531_en_afkz-0027 from afghanistan went into the centre of athens two months ago and lives constant fear of attack
20130101_20130531_en_afkz-0028 i was going around the corner when suddenly i was punched in my nose
20130101_20130531_en_afkz-0029 but i got several kicks and punches
20130101_20130531_en_afkz-0030 i fell down and they left
20130101_20130531_en_afkz-0033 there is no excuse for tramping on human rights
20130101_20130531_en_afkz-0034 regardless economic situation or any other situation greece has been a migrant country itself
20130101_20130531_en_afkz-0035 greece
20130101_20130531_en_afkz-0036 international treaties and greece ought to respect that
20130101_20130531_en_afkz-0037 protect human rights regardless of the
20130101_20130531_en_afkz-0038 the
20130101_20130531_en_afkz-0039 the of
20130101_20130531_en_afkz-0041 other european representatives they are trying to develop a common response to the dismal and dangerous
20130101_20130531_en_afkz-0042 asylum seekers face out of our coordination with italy and spain we gain
20130101_20130531_en_afkz-0043 less
20130101_20130531_en_afkz-0044 face the same problems all of us
20130101_20130531_en_afkz-0045 all of us have
20130101_20130531_en_afkz-0046 a lot of refugees and asylum seekers
20130101_20130531_en_afkz-0047 i that comparing all
20130101_20130531_en_afkz-0048 we can have a result in order to understand the situation so that we can do something
20130101_20130531_en_afkz-0050 even though he received his refugee passport quite quickly one and a half years
20130101_20130531_en_afkz-0051 is of many to escape for a second
20130101_20130531_en_afkz-0052 my big dream is to go to france to do a
20130101_20130531_en_afkz-0053 degree to go ahead with my work in cinema
20130101_20130531_en_afla-0001 forty years after they shot to fame by winning the eurovision song contest
20130101_20130531_en_afla-0002 is in
20130101_20130531_en_afla-0003 to
20130101_20130531_en_afla-0005 and early
20130101_20130531_en_afla-0006 but a very modern touch as well
20130101_20130531_en_afla-0007 the mixing and the studio we have all
20130101_20130531_en_afla-0009 significant
20130101_20130531_en_afla-0010 but then we to add something more to make it a really fun experience
20130101_20130531_en_afla-0012 while the same time your performance being filmed and put on your ticket homepage because each ticket to museum is connected to an individual
20130101_20130531_en_afla-0013 the of a
20130101_20130531_en_afla-0015 member got involved the project took off
20130101_20130531_en_afla-0016 museums
20130101_20130531_en_afla-0017 are about dead people usually
20130101_20130531_en_afla-0019 with yourself
20130101_20130531_en_afla-0020 kind of
20130101_20130531_en_afla-0021 it suddenly dawned on
20130101_20130531_en_afla-0022 that is going to
20130101_20130531_en_afla-0023 people will want to go there and they ask me what is it like
20130101_20130531_en_afla-0024 and when i realised that i thought i had to
20130101_20130531_en_afla-0025 to make sure
20130101_20130531_en_afla-0026 that they do everything to make it as good as possible
20130101_20130531_en_afla-0028 to
20130101_20130531_en_afla-0029 tell this story
20130101_20130531_en_afla-0030 again
20130101_20130531_en_afla-0031 the museum officially opens its doors to the public
20130101_20130531_en_afla-0032 plenty of time to say thank you for

20130101_20130531_en_aflb-0002 many people then took the weather as omen for the french president in the months that followed many their doubts came true

20130101_20130531_en_aflb-0024 because we are in a storm
20130101_20130531_en_aflb-0025 and in a storm you should react in an extremely energetic way

20130101_20130531_en_aflb-0027 and when he speaks publicly he tends to de dramatise things
20130101_20130531_en_aflb-0030 he gives the impression of someone in power

20130101_20130531_en_aflb-0036 by re shuffling the cabinet
20130101_20130531_en_aflb-0037 in my opinion the current team is too big
20130101_20130531_en_aflb-0038 there are lots of ministers who nobody knows their absence be missed
20130101_20130531_en_aflb-0039 needs a tighter team with stronger personalities
20130101_20130531_en_aflb-0040 with the same minister
20130101_20130531_en_aflb-0042 but the french team must be tighter second point some structural reforms have to be launched now even some time before effects are felt
20130101_20130531_en_aflb-0043 i think fair to say that france has decided to make difficult and much needed
20130101_20130531_en_aflb-0044 reforms national reforms example and pension reforms
20130101_20130531_en_aflb-0045 in exchange for slightly loosening the chains of austerity
20130101_20130531_en_aflb-0048 yes it is going to count because the so called
20130101_20130531_en_aflb-0049 left are people who are honest they rich are of the political left so they bring their financial power to the establishment
20130101_20130531_en_aflb-0050 and then settle into

20130101_20130531_en_aflb-0061 only thing that can prevent that from happening apart from an economic recovery is that all the allies of the left rally around a single candidate to avoid a disaster like the one that happened to

20130101_20130531_en_afmd-0005 very beautiful she was wearing a lot of jewelry which means she just got engaged
20130101_20130531_en_afmd-0006 my was congratulating her in a very weird way

20130101_20130531_en_afmd-0010 that really blew me away

20130101_20130531_en_afmg-0006 we are not everything in europe but without france and germany and without our close cooperation nothing works
20130101_20130531_en_afmg-0007 this was the beginning of european
20130101_20130531_en_afmg-0008 and it is the prerequisite for a
20130101_20130531_en_afmg-0009 continuation
20130101_20130531_en_afmg-0010 and if in some areas we have differing opinions can learn and profit from each other
20130101_20130531_en_afmg-0011 the two countries have followed different industrial paths in the last few decades france believes they are still complementary
20130101_20130531_en_afmg-0013 this is a promise will make here in berlin and which will be kept i assure you
20130101_20130531_en_afmg-0015 while france gets the most out of consumer goods while leaving older industries to wither away
20130101_20130531_en_afmg-0016 politically they remain close

20130101_20130531_en_afmj-0026 to work we need to get up close and personal the screen itself
20130101_20130531_en_afmj-0027 the image is composed of thousands of little dots
20130101_20130531_en_afmj-0028 change colour and brightness
20130101_20130531_en_afmj-0029 is
20130101_20130531_en_afmj-0030 two optical filters which are identical and they are an integral part of every liquid crystal display
20130101_20130531_en_afmj-0031 these filters have the property that they pass only light which oscillates in one direction
20130101_20130531_en_afmj-0032 that means place these two filters behind each other in parallel then the light can pass they are bright if i rotate one of these filters by ninety degrees then light cannot pass and the display appears so to say black and a liquid crystal display does this manual rotation electrically
20130101_20130531_en_afmj-0033 these filters represent a little dot in this way brightness each dot can be graduated from dark to light and the colours can be adjusted with the appropriate filters
20130101_20130531_en_afmj-0034 in this way the optical signal each of the thousands of dots is created

20130101_20130531_en_afmj-0045 this is very exciting and it never ends

20130101_20130531_en_afmj-0047 that this is very useful for a lot of people
20130101_20130531_en_afmj-0048 it enables you to communicate
20130101_20130531_en_afmj-0049 machines with cars with airplanes and so on and this is very exciting

20130101_20130531_en_afmk-0003 and
20130101_20130531_en_afmk-0004 for me is
20130101_20130531_en_afmk-0005 electric energy
20130101_20130531_en_afmk-0006 i

20130101_20130531_en_afmk-0011 i think something very obsessive about the bolero with the repetition of a that grows and grows during fifteen minutes at the time it was a very avant garde piece that had a strong influence on minimal music and techno movement and i think that working in such an obsessive way with the dancers on this ie of rotation has a lot to do in a certain way with performance art and with what marina is looking for
20130101_20130531_en_afmk-0012 so difficult to
20130101_20130531_en_afmk-0013 everything right the right light the right
20130101_20130531_en_afmk-0014 right dance the right music and then the energy of the dancers
20130101_20130531_en_afmk-0015 i think
20130101_20130531_en_afmk-0016 the new bolero runs at the garnier paris

20130101_20130531_en_afns-0003 improved the technology
20130101_20130531_en_afns-0004 there is a physical phenomenon called destructive interference it means that waves are travelling into space

20130101_20130531_en_afns-0006 the same frequency but shifted by one hundred eighty degrees they will interfere with each other and cancel each

20130101_20130531_en_afnt-0003 running in parallel with the festival is a forum called european lab designed to promote discussion about cultural challenges in europe
20130101_20130531_en_afnt-0005 i think europe needs to take a look at itself that means seeing our diversity the negative horrible side of diversity is nationalism but as a basic principle diversity something positive and i think a festival like this can give new inspirations

20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0002 guest
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0003 this week is mister tonio borg who is the eu commissioner for health and consumer policy many thanks for joining us
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0004 straight to our first question
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0006 from east flanders i like to know what the european union is doing prevent horse meat from being sold as
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0007 you have just presented a new set of eu food safety proposals but to wait two thousand sixteen until they are adopted into law possibly what happens in the meantime of all horse meat scandal was a safety issue
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0008 it was a question fraud against the consumer a
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0010 in fact we have legislation on labelling what is important is that when people are caught
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0011 eu law they are
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0012 punished
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0013 we already have dissuasive and appropriate punishment applied by member states we are going to increase the
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0014 by
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0015 legislating to the effect that the pecuniary penalty to be equal to the economic gain made out of the violation of
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0016 and then be other inspections unannounced and also the commission will be able to oblige member states to do the testing i must say testing dna was done by all member states beyond the number suggested i guess that you must be expecting something like to happen again possibly in the near future because this is the result of an economic crisis where suppliers are squeezed financially to provide cheaper and cheaper
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0018 is a law there is nothing
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0019 anyone from violating it what is important is that
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0020 he or she is caught and that that person is judged by the state courts in the member states i must say that the entire scandal was discovered through enforcement by a member state in this case
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0021 china is at the moment in the throes of a food scandal itself where
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0023 conduct inspections outside the european union so that importation of food products from outside the
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0024 to come from certain approved sites sometimes even approved regions so this is the
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0025 can you be sure that meat china is
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0026 sometimes we import food products from outside the
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0027 we are not completely self but there a possibility that this tainted meat could reach europe
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0028 not that i know of because we do sound inspections outside the
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0029 can i mean even three summers ago there was the importation of vegetables from outside the
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0030 which happened to be contaminated and we had
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0031 in that respect so

20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0035 world
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0036 and we should be proud of
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0037 to our next question which comes from latvia
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0039 a
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0040 will be enforced
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0042 there was resistance against this ban but there was an absolute majority in favour there the qualified majority in favour neither against in which case the commission proceeds with ban and that is law so it will be
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0043 and if member states do not enforce it then
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0044 commission to start infringement proceedings
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0045 fighting a very powerful lobby the pesticide lobby and been arguing that over the course of five years if this ban were to go to years this the economy like
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0046 seventeen billion euros something like fifty jobs what do you say to that i must say that
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0047 some member states have already implemented
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0048 the ban the ban itself and these economic apocalyptic consequences did not result so we have to protect our bees because bees are doing this pollination
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0049 which
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0050 if it had to be translated into euros it would
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0051 euros as
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0052 pesticide companies acting in bad faith
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0053 saying that they are not correct
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0054 this position and
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0055 it is scientific evidence which has
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0056 been the basis
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0058 they cannot ignore this scientific opinion
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0061 i have a question to ask
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0062 ageing population
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0063 how will the eu manage health issues in the future
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0065 be over sixty is it
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0066 in terms of looking after
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0067 in these times of economic crisis there will be cuts budgets as i mean this will be normal so rather than whining about these cuts one has to
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0068 spend money in a smarter way without however
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0069 going
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0070 the threshold of what is essential for healthcare particularly
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0071 the
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0072 we have what we call the
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0073 partnership on healthy ageing which we promote the european commission but also have to discover new means of cutting costs and retaining
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0074 for instance
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0075 it would be something very if all member states would indulge in this
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0076 i will be visiting northern ireland next week to
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0077 see what they have done
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0078 which was a very successful experiment more than twenty
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0079 patients involved
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0080 monitored your health situation is monitored from the centre and you remain at home would be beneficial
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0081 for those who have reached a certain age rather than going to clinics and covering these distances would be
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0082 and monitored while staying at home and the same time costs
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0083 for the state you
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0085 everybody
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0086 because
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0087 likes cuts even the
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0088 redraft its budget because of the cuts which
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0090 of health across
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0092 establish a panel of experts within
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0093 my services to give the proper advice
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0094 health systems otherwise they will
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0095 viable
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0097 now not only in our economies but also in our health systems then we are inviting
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0098 big for the future
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0099 better to take the preventive medicine
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0100 is to the eu how much national governments spend on health
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0101 a question of subsidiarity
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0102 very strong in the health sector so actually coordinate
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0103 try and help states reach their
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0104 but it remains the prime responsibility of the member states what we are
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0105 is to invest more in prevention
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0106 only three percent is
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0107 the troika has actually slashed spending on health in greece and portugal yes as well which does not mean slashing directly
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0108 trying to use the funds that they have in a smarter way
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0109 so it is in the interest of the member states to reform their health
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0110 want viable health systems for the future and finally
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0111 slightly off topic you were elected commissioner there was some controversy over your personal views particularly same sex
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0112 divorce what you say to your detractors who said that your personal values would affect policy
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0113 judge me by actions i think i have been very active in
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0114 certain respects as regards animal welfare as regards other issues as well and i have respected the principle of subsidiarity that is to say in most matters which you have mentioned are the
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0115 member states and not of the commission and your personal values will not influence policy making values are my personal values they are important in the same way other commissioners have their personal values but we here as commissioners and we apply eu
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0116 commissioner many thanks for joining us on

20130101_20130531_en_afpd-0003 backlash against prefabricated plastic pop and extended throughout the to other creative disciplines including fashion until eventually it in its turn became
20130101_20130531_en_afpd-0004 punk was all celebrating individual
20130101_20130531_en_afpd-0005 celebrating creativity
20130101_20130531_en_afpd-0006 and not being afraid be brave in your self presentation and to be brave in your statements
20130101_20130531_en_afpd-0007 punk was all about the status quo and challenging what we by beauty
20130101_20130531_en_afpd-0008 and i think all those elements
20130101_20130531_en_afpd-0009 have much impacted fashion
20130101_20130531_en_afpd-0010 british
20130101_20130531_en_afpd-0011 zandra rhodes was one of those who embraced this new freedom within
20130101_20130531_en_afpd-0013 and a safety pin and chain be as fabulous as using sequins
20130101_20130531_en_afpd-0017 for
20130101_20130531_en_afpe-0001 bye alex is the eurovision hopeful from hungary although he the obvious choice
20130101_20130531_en_afpe-0002 in early rounds of the competition
20130101_20130531_en_afpe-0003 really expected him to win
20130101_20130531_en_afpe-0005 his song is a simple ballad called my darling deals with unconditional love
20130101_20130531_en_afpe-0006 he is a
20130101_20130531_en_afpe-0007 graduate and wrote the song himself
20130101_20130531_en_afpe-0008 i went through a time in life and that was when i created an ideal character
20130101_20130531_en_afpe-0009 we all have one in our lives a character within an idealised world many people
20130101_20130531_en_afpe-0011 originally bye alex was not that keen to enter the contest as he dislikes publicity and the celebrity
20130101_20130531_en_afpe-0012 in hungary pop music been westernised
20130101_20130531_en_afpe-0013 we want our music to sound exactly the same as in the uk or the us
20130101_20130531_en_afpe-0014 but the difference with those countries is that pop music is their conventional music
20130101_20130531_en_afpe-0015 here there was maybe ten fifteen years ago a big turnaround to westernise music
20130101_20130531_en_afpe-0016 and perhaps now this is turning back because people did not vote for a conventional pop song for eurovision but for a song that means a lot many people
20130101_20130531_en_afpe-0017 bye alex says he will perform his song in hungarian with english subtitles

20130101_20130531_en_afpi-0001 a group of brazilian and japanese scientists working on the south atlantic seabed have found continental that could be remains of the so called lost continent
20130101_20130531_en_afpi-0002 using a submersible capable of descending to depths of six five meters and collecting samples
20130101_20130531_en_afpi-0003 they have discovered a granite formation on the rio grande elevation a rise on the ocean floor about one five hundred
20130101_20130531_en_afpi-0004 southeast of rio de janeiro
20130101_20130531_en_afpi-0005 according to geologists as a result of tectonic movements a land mass which was once above sea level could have sunk into the ocean

20130101_20130531_en_afpi-0007 came aboard the ship the surprise was what are these rocks doing here we did petrographic geochemical and geological studies of this material at the time we came up with the study results which even unexpected surprise for us
20130101_20130531_en_afpi-0008 the fact that it in the rio grande rise region which is a rise with shallower water and with lower gravimetric density than normal oceanic

20130101_20130531_en_afqp-0005 the good news is some stability and confidence has come back into the global economy but got much to do
20130101_20130531_en_afqp-0007 the role of central banks in stimulating growth and intervening more directly will be a major topic of discussion
20130101_20130531_en_afqp-0008 so will the weakening yen which has come about just such an intervention and is subject to scrutiny by those fear it will price their exports out of the marketplace

20130101_20130531_en_afqq-0009 and in the longer term if the economy does not grow in response to this medicine

20130101_20130531_en_afrp-0008 the
20130101_20130531_en_afrp-0009 the truth of the matter
20130101_20130531_en_afrp-0010 and i think that as a nation we need to come to terms with
20130101_20130531_en_afrp-0011 do we to prevent it but also recognize that fusion centers
20130101_20130531_en_afrp-0012 and intelligence analysis and joint terrorism task forces are part of our future

20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0001 sir alex
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0002 retirement signalled the end of an era for premiership football the seventy-one year old has steered
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0003 one of the most successful clubs in the world but now he will hand the reigns over to someone else
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0004 the great legacy sir alex on along with the great pressures
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0006 what we expect from david moyes it is a tough challenge for anybody it tough challenge
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0007 to go into one of the top three best clubs
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0008 in europe in the world
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0010 i think has everything
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0013 the emphasis on the set up so i think that what sir alex
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0014 has left behind
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0015 is going to help moyes
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0016 no end
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0018 you will never give up manchester united will never
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0019 give up
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0021 will stay with the club because
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0023 has a lot of things for him thanks and courtesy of sir alex
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0024 sure
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0026 a massive show of confidence from united for moyes
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0028 such
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0029 a lengthy contract
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0030 but again as i said it just shows confidence they have in
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0031 sir alex ferguson and
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0032 david moyes go back quite a way
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0033 david moyes was getting his coaching badges he was going through a programme with the scottish fa coaching courses and
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0034 at that time the programme was led by sir alex
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0035 sir alex ferguson has kept a very eye on moyes
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0036 he was at preston north end coaching there and steered them to promotion
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0037 but i think two years prior to that
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0038 were thinking about or contemplating
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0039 hiring
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0040 for the
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0041 assistant coaching before steve mcclaren actually took the post so i think
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0043 many player past and
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0044 have
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0045 come out and backed moyes as the natural successor
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0046 so a lot of people have confidence in
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0048 be worst type of back seat driver can imagine
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0049 as you know
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0052 for the club
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0053 but i think ferguson knows
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0055 this new role
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0056 with
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0057 being a public master or an overlord of moyes in mind
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0058 i think he knows better and i think he respects moyes
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0059 better than that
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0061 be too much a painful backseat driver as you said
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0062 but
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0063 moyes has enough respect for ferguson as well that
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0065 in relation to the big stars in team
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0066 again
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0068 the same cloth
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0069 similar to
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0070 steely fiery character
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0072 will get into shape
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0073 and i think again that legacy that ferguson has left behind no man is bigger than the club i think moyes will carry that
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0074 perfectly and
20130101_20130531_en_afrr-0001 those who have escaped violence in syria this is where hundred
20130101_20130531_en_afrr-0002 have taken shelter waiting to return home

20130101_20130531_en_afrr-0007 it is a matter of
20130101_20130531_en_afrr-0008 solution to put an to the fighting
20130101_20130531_en_afrr-0009 the neighbourhood we can help stabilise it now
20130101_20130531_en_afrr-0010 as we do so as we put more resources work hard to increase the efficiency of aid delivery
20130101_20130531_en_afrr-0011 over one million have syria since the conflict began concerns are growing over a

20130101_20130531_en_aftl-0004 as with much in medical engineering design and innovation moves swiftly
20130101_20130531_en_aftl-0005 pacemakers have evolved rapidly over the years
20130101_20130531_en_aftl-0006 less than half their original size and
20130101_20130531_en_aftl-0007 here on
20130101_20130531_en_aftl-0008 we have a connector which links the pacemaker through a probe in the heart

20130101_20130531_en_aftl-0010 a smaller device means the entire chain of production is changed
20130101_20130531_en_aftl-0011 we need to find technologies make smaller and smaller for example this exterior battery is ten times smaller than the ones we use today you can imagine the technical
20130101_20130531_en_aftl-0012 that presents to our engineers
20130101_20130531_en_aftl-0013 as the pacemaker becomes smaller surgeons say there is a real possibility of inserting it into a patient via a catheter through a small incision in
20130101_20130531_en_aftl-0014 a less invasive
20130101_20130531_en_aftl-0015 and less complicated
20130101_20130531_en_aftl-0016 but the devices are still in the testing stage and
20130101_20130531_en_aftl-0017 say it will be three to five years before the new miniature pacemakers will start to be used

20130101_20130531_en_aftn-0007 nineteen this vast expanse of land thirty kilometres square is wildlife paradise humans are few and far between
20130101_20130531_en_aftn-0008 the only people we across are fishermen they come here all year round from russia and from abroad
20130101_20130531_en_aftn-0010 from their camp sites on the banks of the volga river fishermen take an hour long boat ride to where the river runs into the sea
20130101_20130531_en_aftn-0013 when you stand you feel one with nature
20130101_20130531_en_aftn-0014 the thread the fishing line becomes a bond
20130101_20130531_en_aftn-0015 it makes you feel a connection to the huge river and the world around you
20130101_20130531_en_aftn-0016 says
20130101_20130531_en_aftn-0017 about killing animals he returns his catch to the river
20130101_20130531_en_aftn-0018 for him an intellectual game
20130101_20130531_en_aftn-0020 get this crazy adrenaline rush the fish bites and you feel the tug on your line all you want is to catch it you want to be the best and you want it to be a big fish
20130101_20130531_en_aftn-0022 for many locals however this is how earn a living
20130101_20130531_en_aftn-0023 their catch is sold and to canning factories onshore
20130101_20130531_en_aftn-0025 so there much fish
20130101_20130531_en_aftn-0027 large fish are growing scarce

20130101_20130531_en_aftn-0034 but a saying

20130101_20130531_en_aftn-0038 it will be used to cook the dish that crowns any successful fishing trip
20130101_20130531_en_aftn-0039 a tasty broth prepared over an open fire with freshly caught

20130101_20130531_en_afto-0001 as iran prepares for presidential elections on fourteen june analysts have been looking closely at the frontrunners in the islamic republic most of the six hundred eighty-six would be candidates to succeed outgoing president mahmoud ahmadinejad are conservative thirty of them are women
20130101_20130531_en_afto-0003 may in the two thousand nine poll four candidates stood in the end
20130101_20130531_en_afto-0004 supreme leader ayatollah sayed ali
20130101_20130531_en_afto-0005 has indicated some leniency toward reformist voices although today much of the opposition has been silenced
20130101_20130531_en_afto-0007 six months of unprecedented street clashes followed
20130101_20130531_en_afto-0008 two thousand nine re election
20130101_20130531_en_afto-0009 many iranians were discouraged the brutality of the crackdown against their complaints that the polling was flawed and their reformist wishes had been ignored
20130101_20130531_en_afto-0012 and afterwards also close to
20130101_20130531_en_afto-0016 feared to be weapons
20130101_20130531_en_afto-0017 but which iran says is fully peaceful
20130101_20130531_en_afto-0018 many ordinary iranians feel held

20130101_20130531_en_afto-0024 what can we learn from this preliminary stage for the elections
20130101_20130531_en_afto-0025 the plan by the supreme leader and those close to him is to hold an election where a reformist candidate is presented but is weak
20130101_20130531_en_afto-0026 the two dominant streams close to the leader are the decision making military and the core hardliners
20130101_20130531_en_afto-0027 they occupy front row seats in the household of power
20130101_20130531_en_afto-0028 they want a candidate who is unable to attract many votes
20130101_20130531_en_afto-0029 they want someone who could be present at a lower level of the establishment just to add to the total voter turnout
20130101_20130531_en_afto-0030 and enhance the election process
20130101_20130531_en_afto-0032 they hoped that someone else would replace him
20130101_20130531_en_afto-0035 the balance changes
20130101_20130531_en_afto-0036 this helped the
20130101_20130531_en_afto-0038 we can say that this manoeuvre by rafsanjani changes the balance of power
20130101_20130531_en_afto-0039 although the contest is just getting started it
20130101_20130531_en_afto-0040 is not clear which direction the election is going to take
20130101_20130531_en_afto-0041 iran is a country where outcomes are
20130101_20130531_en_afto-0042 in the final minute of play
20130101_20130531_en_afto-0044 there are many things over which the conservative factions disagree
20130101_20130531_en_afto-0046 forward as a candidate
20130101_20130531_en_afto-0048 tries to wait until the last minute to find out which conservative is more powerful than
20130101_20130531_en_afto-0049 the
20130101_20130531_en_afto-0051 choosing will be very difficult
20130101_20130531_en_afto-0052 the same time permitting an all out competition would be very complicated there are reformist candidates who have stood behind rafsanjani and this adds to his power
20130101_20130531_en_afto-0054 and
20130101_20130531_en_afto-0055 with all those unresolved will this election have any legitimacy
20130101_20130531_en_afto-0056 the danger that iran is feeling lies in the direction that of the islamic republic have taken in past years
20130101_20130531_en_afto-0057 these policies risk turning iran into a north korea in terms of its institutions

20130101_20130531_en_afvc-0009 inside the orange magnets a special
20130101_20130531_en_afvc-0010 is installed to make the protons travel towards the treatment

20130101_20130531_en_afvc-0012 while conventional radiation can damage healthy tissues proton beams deliver their

20130101_20130531_en_afvc-0025 the strength of the beam can also be regulated

20130101_20130531_en_afxr-0009 to the standards
20130101_20130531_en_afxr-0010 living
20130101_20130531_en_afxr-0011 of the
20130101_20130531_en_afxr-0012 european
20130101_20130531_en_afxs-0002 windows showcasing the latest fashions
20130101_20130531_en_afxs-0004 i dummy only takes up to eight seconds go from large to small and back again
20130101_20130531_en_afxs-0005 width
20130101_20130531_en_afxs-0006 and length can be altered simultaneously
20130101_20130531_en_afxs-0007 in the course of the study researchers encountered a crucial problem
20130101_20130531_en_afxs-0008 could they establish a way of measuring growth from one size to another accurately and in proportion
20130101_20130531_en_afxs-0009 of when one person gets bigger
20130101_20130531_en_afxs-0010 the
20130101_20130531_en_afxs-0011 and so on
20130101_20130531_en_afxs-0012 not be in same proportion so we have to calculate
20130101_20130531_en_afxs-0013 people when we study the american size
20130101_20130531_en_afxs-0014 we the european we study the japanese and also as well as the hong kong female
20130101_20130531_en_afxs-0015 body profile and from
20130101_20130531_en_afxs-0016 we can
20130101_20130531_en_afxs-0017 get the right proportion
20130101_20130531_en_afxs-0018 one size
20130101_20130531_en_afxs-0019 so in terms of the as well as the
20130101_20130531_en_afxs-0020 this ability to mimic different body profiles means the i dummy is also an excellent educational and training tool for students of fashion design and pattern development
20130101_20130531_en_afxs-0021 perhaps most important of
20130101_20130531_en_afxs-0022 the i dummy can be easily controlled via a user friendly computer interface so potential clients can input their measurements online
20130101_20130531_en_afxt-0002 is its acting president
20130101_20130531_en_afxt-0003 mali had high expectations for this donors conference more than three billion euros of financial
20130101_20130531_en_afxt-0004 has been offered those promises still have to be realised but your hopes have been surpassed what assurances will you be giving that the will well used
20130101_20130531_en_afxt-0005 right in saying that everyone in mali was watching this conference unfold and that we had our hopes lifted
20130101_20130531_en_afxt-0006 that we might benefit international solidarity
20130101_20130531_en_afxt-0007 and especially european solidarity
20130101_20130531_en_afxt-0008 to begin putting into practice our programme to
20130101_20130531_en_afxt-0009 development
20130101_20130531_en_afxt-0010 you heard the french president ask that each euro be spent effectively and openly
20130101_20130531_en_afxt-0011 yes we are aware that our partners have gone to great efforts
20130101_20130531_en_afxt-0012 the european international
20130101_20130531_en_afxt-0013 and the least that we do
20130101_20130531_en_afxt-0015 are respected
20130101_20130531_en_afxt-0018 french troops have started to withdraw a united nations stabilisation mission is going to take over from them with african soldiers staying in
20130101_20130531_en_afxt-0021 are you preparing for a drawn out conflict perhaps guerrilla warfare as other countries have experienced
20130101_20130531_en_afxt-0022 yes
20130101_20130531_en_afxt-0024 today they opt suicide attacks
20130101_20130531_en_afxt-0025 and we
20130101_20130531_en_afxt-0026 see a booby trapped vehicle explode
20130101_20130531_en_afxt-0030 this kind of activity
20130101_20130531_en_afxt-0031 but i believe we can handle that well
20130101_20130531_en_afxt-0033 are you going to have anything to do with them is it possible to reach an agreement with a movement that had a pact with the jihadists early in crisis
20130101_20130531_en_afxt-0035 and as soon as we talk about territorial integrity
20130101_20130531_en_afxt-0038 there are in it who came from
20130101_20130531_en_afxt-0039 and so on but if they renounce going off on their independent way
20130101_20130531_en_afxt-0040 and commit to respecting a secular state
20130101_20130531_en_afxt-0041 and if they subscribe to the
20130101_20130531_en_afxt-0042 process we are ready to talk with them about all the other questions which might interest them
20130101_20130531_en_afxt-0043 might provide them with solutions within a democracy in decentralisation and many other solutions
20130101_20130531_en_afxt-0046 what precisely are the limits of this decentralisation
20130101_20130531_en_afxt-0051 way to convince the donors france to begin with to give you more
20130101_20130531_en_afxt-0053 and we know this is a genuine
20130101_20130531_en_afxt-0054 but
20130101_20130531_en_afxt-0055 we wanted to show our determination
20130101_20130531_en_afxt-0056 to make the transition as short as possible
20130101_20130531_en_afxt-0057 because mali facing so many serious
20130101_20130531_en_afxt-0058 the sooner the transition ends the sooner it will be possible to tackle the real problems
20130101_20130531_en_afxt-0059 we have to understand that only an elected government
20130101_20130531_en_afxt-0060 more legitimacy and more time
20130101_20130531_en_afxt-0061 can take care of the real problems of the country
20130101_20130531_en_afxt-0063 we decided this and we all our partners and friends to help us stick to the timetable
20130101_20130531_en_afxt-0064 how are to get the people
20130101_20130531_en_afxt-0065 how will you make the three hundred people who been displaced to the of the country vote

20130101_20130531_en_afxu-0012 always seems
20130101_20130531_en_afxu-0013 a bit like false optimism

20130101_20130531_en_afxv-0004 must be
20130101_20130531_en_afxv-0005 but not by firing civil servants like they want us to believe
20130101_20130531_en_afxv-0006 it should be done by eliminating some sectors or agencies that been created over the last thirty years and are absolutely useless for the portuguese economy

20130101_20130531_en_afxv-0009 and cut expenditure
20130101_20130531_en_afxv-0010 but the measures appear to have made the country worse off than in eleven according to european indicators

20130101_20130531_en_agaf-0013 have thought
20130101_20130531_en_agag-0002 it is ten years since casablanca was rocked by five explosions in twenty minutes
20130101_20130531_en_agag-0004 several ngos got together to call for peace and unity to counter extremist ideologies
20130101_20130531_en_agag-0005 living in this painful life we ask all muslims in morocco to become a model for arab and muslim world and not participate in terrorism
20130101_20130531_en_agag-0007 we have organised this sit in to demand the truth about the explosions sixteen may two thousand three in casablanca
20130101_20130531_en_agag-0008 ten years later we still do not know the real cause of these explosions
20130101_20130531_en_agag-0009 these events have caused thousands of casualties among islamists who been tortured and imprisoned
20130101_20130531_en_agag-0010 and all without us really who behind the attacks said
20130101_20130531_en_agag-0011 the attacks were on western targets the first carried out in by moroccans
20130101_20130531_en_agag-0012 six european lives were lost in total and the country was shocked by the indiscriminate carnage of the suicide bombers
20130101_20130531_en_agah-0001 so many syrians are fleeing the war in their country
20130101_20130531_en_agah-0003 grid hospitals transportation and other services rents in lebanon have soared along with food prices but several economists point out there are benefits from the influx of refugees saying their spending is helping particularly in deprived rural areas some syrians are even taking the opportunity to start businesses

20130101_20130531_en_agah-0005 he is being like any other businessman has had no trouble getting permits and all employees are syrians
20130101_20130531_en_agah-0007 the lebanese economy is under pressure from the crisis in syria more than half a million syrians have fled to lebanon in search of safety some lebanese consider a burden while others see them as powerful positive influence on the economy
20130101_20130531_en_agah-0008 to learn more we
20130101_20130531_en_agah-0009 lebanese former finance minister
20130101_20130531_en_agah-0011 there are two points of view in lebanon
20130101_20130531_en_agah-0012 the first is economic
20130101_20130531_en_agah-0013 saying that the arrivals are a stimulus for various markets
20130101_20130531_en_agah-0014 especially housing
20130101_20130531_en_agah-0015 especially well syrians
20130101_20130531_en_agah-0016 on the other hand
20130101_20130531_en_agah-0017 some people are asking a lot of questions
20130101_20130531_en_agah-0018 about how much influx lebanon can bear
20130101_20130531_en_agah-0019 point of view reflects a political and
20130101_20130531_en_agah-0020 vision about immigration
20130101_20130531_en_agah-0021 one the reasons
20130101_20130531_en_agah-0022 with the rise in the total number of inhabitants
20130101_20130531_en_agah-0023 is the lebanese fear that they will represent a shrinking proportion of the population
20130101_20130531_en_agah-0024 what effect has there been on the lebanese economy from increase in investments and syrian manpower
20130101_20130531_en_agah-0025 syrian workers especially in the construction
20130101_20130531_en_agah-0026 have brought their families to lebanon
20130101_20130531_en_agah-0027 and have also registered them as refugees
20130101_20130531_en_agah-0028 this is why we see this rise in the number of
20130101_20130531_en_agah-0029 syrian manpower is a key element in the economic system of lebanon
20130101_20130531_en_agah-0030 has the refugee influx had a negative impact on the tourism sector
20130101_20130531_en_agah-0031 on the contrary
20130101_20130531_en_agah-0032 for instance in beirut
20130101_20130531_en_agah-0033 or some of the tourist regions
20130101_20130531_en_agah-0034 there are furnished apartments for rent
20130101_20130531_en_agah-0035 well off syrian refugees
20130101_20130531_en_agah-0036 have replaced tourism tenants
20130101_20130531_en_agah-0037 who before came from the
20130101_20130531_en_agah-0040 the
20130101_20130531_en_agah-0041 government has asked various arab and international players
20130101_20130531_en_agah-0042 to help it care of the syrian
20130101_20130531_en_agah-0043 it seems that the lebanese government has not received what it asked for
20130101_20130531_en_agah-0044 solution things calm down in syria so the syrian refugees can back to their country

20130101_20130531_en_agby-0036 hippocampus the region responsible for memory
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0037 why is it more developed london taxi drivers well because
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0039 brain plasticity is result of many different things
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0040 neurons come top of list
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0041 they are able to organise by themselves they networks
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0042 the more stimulate them the more these networks of neurons will be developed and reliable on the
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0043 the less you stimulate neurons the more these networks

20130101_20130531_en_agby-0045 engaged in hands on brain research activities
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0046 the deepest molecular secrets of ageing brains
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0048 at neurons the nerve cells
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0049 have a lot of contact between each other
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0050 first these contacts
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0051 then after they lose contacts the neuron nerve cells will die and
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0052 this is what goes
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0053 disease
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0054 want to
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0055 is
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0056 what is the step of this process when a patient goes to the
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0057 already with
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0058 are already
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0059 lost
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0060 dead
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0061 we want to go back
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0062 five or eight years
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0063 time
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0064 far
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0067 very important to understand why
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0068 people remain
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0069 whether they have any protective genetic alteration
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0070 so in our project we not only focus on
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0071 but we also to focus on protective factors what of genetic constellation
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0072 can protect against
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0073 disease
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0074 if we this genetic alteration we can translate
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0075 to
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0076 and then we can generate a marker or we can
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0077 try to
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0078 these
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0079 for
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0080 we can generate something can then be useful for other
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0081 have amazing still hugely unexplored capabilities
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0082 they can for instance control robots or machines through computers
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0083 techniques known as brain computer interfaces are already been used by researchers to hope to people with no or reduced mobility in their or legs
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0084 we see more and more
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0085 are able to use their brains to
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0086 through computers
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0087 know that brains have incredible
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0088 and depending on you connect them to brains will be to kind of communicate with those machines so it is really hard to see what the limits of brains
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0089 the
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0090 to turn lights on off
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0091 electrodes around the skull detect when electrical signals in the brain are more or active
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0092 a computer reads that brain activity and translates it into orders to the light
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0093 researchers think the brain can be stimulated to do much more
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0094 it could for instance help paraplegics
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0095 interact mentally video games
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0096 the be to come
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0097 computer
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0098 brain computer interfacing basically works
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0099 electrodes
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0100 at the right spots on the head where certain brainwaves can be measured
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0101 for system only one change in the brain signal enough build a control just as when you are using something you refer to a single switch to activate a certain control we can also use a single brain signal to activate a certain control in some machines
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0102 researchers are already testing possibilities of controlling sophisticated flying machines with a combination of sensor techniques computer vision
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0103 and brainwaves
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0104 and more down to earth extremely practical applications are already way
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0105 one example would be the control with the brain
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0106 in a very solid and precise way
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0107 or controlling with the brain computer in that way the computer would work a lot faster
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0108 we could also foresee a future where brain signals could control orthosis
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0109 could give highly
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0110 people the possibility to grab
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0111 again
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0112 far more is still needed researchers conclude before they can solve the many scientific puzzles still posed by our fragile sophisticated and virtually amazing brain
20130101_20130531_en_agbz-0001 with the advent of digital technology it may seem easier ever for independent film makers make movies but if the technology is more accessible
20130101_20130531_en_agbz-0002 getting funding to films in europe is increasingly difficult
20130101_20130531_en_agbz-0003 cutting back on public subsidies
20130101_20130531_en_agbz-0004 how does a young director project on a small
20130101_20130531_en_agbz-0006 has created
20130101_20130531_en_agbz-0007 free database containing documentaries on traditional alternative and forgotten music genres in the portuguese language art forms which are largely absent from the mainstream music industry

20130101_20130531_en_agbz-0009 most recent project
20130101_20130531_en_agbz-0010 i am very pragmatic
20130101_20130531_en_agbz-0013 usually the ideas i have
20130101_20130531_en_agbz-0014 and the places i want to go to are doable
20130101_20130531_en_agbz-0016 is hoping find production partners abroad international co productions are a growing trend but once the film is completed there is still a long way to go very difficult to get your film screened in a classic movie theatre distributors invest in independent films so festivals play an
20130101_20130531_en_agbz-0017 important role
20130101_20130531_en_agbz-0020 the first
20130101_20130531_en_agbz-0021 the film
20130101_20130531_en_agbz-0022 usually they open the door to other commercial possibilities
20130101_20130531_en_agbz-0023 including schools
20130101_20130531_en_agbz-0024 and
20130101_20130531_en_agbz-0025 becoming increasingly difficult
20130101_20130531_en_agbz-0026 in a highly competitive industry dominated
20130101_20130531_en_agbz-0027 is an eu backed network which promotes the screening of european films abroad
20130101_20130531_en_agbz-0028 visited such
20130101_20130531_en_agbz-0029 in lisbon run by film producer paulo branco
20130101_20130531_en_agbz-0030 he says that
20130101_20130531_en_agbz-0031 to get screened in cinemas
20130101_20130531_en_agbz-0033 europe never had a project for european cinema
20130101_20130531_en_agbz-0037 on german italian or french television
20130101_20130531_en_agbz-0038 i mean on public channels
20130101_20130531_en_agbz-0040 lucky with her latest documentary after being at the berlin film
20130101_20130531_en_agbz-0041 it is now leaving the film festival circuit and going
20130101_20130531_en_agbz-0042 across portugal spain and france
20130101_20130531_en_agbz-0043 about democracy
20130101_20130531_en_agbz-0044 something that exists in all regimes
20130101_20130531_en_agbz-0046 or the portuguese colonial war
20130101_20130531_en_agbz-0047 there are always connections with similar situations in other parts of the world
20130101_20130531_en_agca-0001 phoenix are back with a studio
20130101_20130531_en_agca-0002 perfectionists in way that when we make an album
20130101_20130531_en_agca-0003 we know
20130101_20130531_en_agca-0005 we take a lot of time doing this
20130101_20130531_en_agca-0006 when the record is done
20130101_20130531_en_agca-0007 all about imperfection
20130101_20130531_en_agca-0009 one night
20130101_20130531_en_agca-0010 you play a terrible show one night you play a good show
20130101_20130531_en_agca-0011 we write on tour
20130101_20130531_en_agca-0012 so
20130101_20130531_en_agca-0013 we start from scratch
20130101_20130531_en_agca-0015 a
20130101_20130531_en_agca-0016 the amount of time
20130101_20130531_en_agca-0017 to
20130101_20130531_en_agca-0018 be disconnected
20130101_20130531_en_agca-0019 and
20130101_20130531_en_agca-0020 get ready to go back
20130101_20130531_en_agca-0021 the real
20130101_20130531_en_agca-0022 will be playing the european music festival circuit this summer in support of
20130101_20130531_en_agcb-0001 the fizz has come off the european film industry even if the champagne corks are popping in cannes
20130101_20130531_en_agcb-0002 the financial crisis of two thousand seven has the business hard subsidies cut even in countries which previously feather bedded the industry spain for example has seen state aid go from hundred
20130101_20130531_en_agcb-0003 million euros down to fifty-five
20130101_20130531_en_agcb-0005 but it will do in the coming months and years
20130101_20130531_en_agcb-0006 the only bright star at the moment is the uk the now reliable
20130101_20130531_en_agcb-0008 twelve this may be a reflection of the economic times
20130101_20130531_en_agcb-0009 even in france the cold winds of recession are blowing state run france televisions which runs a group of national tv networks will reduce its movie investment by three million euros this year
20130101_20130531_en_agcb-0010 the film industry is not just festivals it is also a business there are cinemas which need to make money given the crisis how are they performing
20130101_20130531_en_agcb-0011 the attendance figures for twelve are quite a bit lower which therefore means there is still a slowdown and there may be the beginning of a
20130101_20130531_en_agcb-0012 do not know exactly what
20130101_20130531_en_agcb-0013 will be what is happening across europe is also uneven not
20130101_20130531_en_agcb-0014 are in the same situation spain for example is experiencing a real crisis for two reasons
20130101_20130531_en_agcb-0015 a crisis in the country as a whole then there is an additional
20130101_20130531_en_agcb-0016 in cinema it has suffered from or three decisions taken by the government including that of increasing vat from eight to twenty-one
20130101_20130531_en_agcb-0017 at the same time crisis in production because what seeing today may
20130101_20130531_en_agcb-0019 in times of crisis some styles of films that work better than others
20130101_20130531_en_agcb-0022 we also think going to the movies also costs fortunately we can go into a cinema and not pay very much this is not the most expensive hobby and get a
20130101_20130531_en_agcb-0023 of great quality so we can the relationship between quality and price is still something
20130101_20130531_en_agcb-0024 the public if we want the public to continue to come and find escapism well there will be perhaps a change in the type of films the movies may have to become more entertainment a little less a place of reflection more a certain pleasure to be found
20130101_20130531_en_agcb-0025 so can summarize the crisis european cinema three words
20130101_20130531_en_agcb-0026 i think that today there are still questions because many countries do not really have the choice to understand culture is
20130101_20130531_en_agcb-0027 response to the crisis
20130101_20130531_en_agcb-0028 one of the concerns we feel in some countries particularly spain
20130101_20130531_en_agcb-0029 as well in some european countries in hungary it is clear that today there are still things which the existence of a that europe
20130101_20130531_en_agcb-0030 arthouse cinema which europe is very good at which can influence the public
20130101_20130531_en_agcb-0031 the movies are really powerful and should not be
20130101_20130531_en_agcb-0032 should be allowed to express
20130101_20130531_en_agcc-0001 the
20130101_20130531_en_agcc-0002 hiv which causes
20130101_20130531_en_agcc-0004 new disease he that thirty-four million people throughout the world are living with it today
20130101_20130531_en_agcc-0005 asked if enough research has been done the past three decades
20130101_20130531_en_agcc-0006 aids is not finished although a lot of young people believe it is because there are medicines for it
20130101_20130531_en_agcc-0007 research is fundamentally
20130101_20130531_en_agcc-0008 since it works towards developing shorter for people theoretically so that after a six to nine month course of treatment they become hiv negative that is not case today and so a lot of has to be done in this area
20130101_20130531_en_agcc-0010 professor montagnier highlighted south africa the second worst affected country is botswana with one in every four adults hiv infected
20130101_20130531_en_agcc-0011 sixty-nine percent of all the hiv cases in the world are in sub africa botswana in two thousand two was the first country to launch an access to programme and to ask hiv infected volunteers to help with prevention
20130101_20130531_en_agcc-0012 is one of these activists in ninety-three when he positive he was devastated
20130101_20130531_en_agcc-0014 of hanging myself
20130101_20130531_en_agcc-0015 and then i started to think
20130101_20130531_en_agcc-0016 life a
20130101_20130531_en_agcc-0017 i am not supposed to take it myself then i started to think
20130101_20130531_en_agcc-0018 from now here what
20130101_20130531_en_agcc-0019 concerted attention is paid to prevention in the united states also
20130101_20130531_en_agcc-0020 religious groups help such as at baptist church in the capital washington
20130101_20130531_en_agcc-0021 leaders are asked to encourage members of spiritual community to have the test done thirty congregations in the dc area are part of this programme
20130101_20130531_en_agcc-0022 faith base is important
20130101_20130531_en_agcc-0023 people lives and they go to the churches to the synagogues to the mosques
20130101_20130531_en_agcc-0024 to seek the solace and comfort of religion
20130101_20130531_en_agcc-0025 huge
20130101_20130531_en_agcc-0026 to
20130101_20130531_en_agcc-0027 to why need to
20130101_20130531_en_agcc-0028 and why this initiative is so important to us
20130101_20130531_en_agcc-0029 according the government one million people are infected with hiv in the us and yet in one of every cases they are not aware that they have the virus this means it can be passed with terrifying damaging effect unknowingly
20130101_20130531_en_agcc-0030 there is one new case every ten minutes in the
20130101_20130531_en_agcc-0031 fifty
20130101_20130531_en_agcc-0032 more people each year who are hiv
20130101_20130531_en_agcc-0033 and therefore liable to fall ill
20130101_20130531_en_agcc-0035 at least the funding of the federal aids programme has bipartisan support
20130101_20130531_en_agcc-0037 a few months ago he retired as us global aids coordinator but still acts as a special advisor buckingham was diagnosed hiv positive twenty-five years ago he has spoken out publicly about living with the disease in a bid to soften the
20130101_20130531_en_agcc-0038 with which it is associated both in the us and africa
20130101_20130531_en_agcc-0039 his home in spring maryland we asked him about how the virus has affected our societies
20130101_20130531_en_agcc-0040 despite of loss despite the death despite the
20130101_20130531_en_agcc-0041 politicisation of many aspects of the epidemic we see that
20130101_20130531_en_agcc-0042 it also has brought about some amazing transformations
20130101_20130531_en_agcc-0043 transformed individual people who are part of the response to aids it changed
20130101_20130531_en_agcc-0044 and
20130101_20130531_en_agcc-0045 to their gay
20130101_20130531_en_agcc-0046 changed how the us government deals with foreign assistance both here in the us and wherever we work around the world we
20130101_20130531_en_agcc-0048 on
20130101_20130531_en_agcc-0049 i think
20130101_20130531_en_agcc-0050 the sort of knee jerk stigma the early years of when was
20130101_20130531_en_agcc-0051 first identified just with gay men and then with injection drug users has
20130101_20130531_en_agcc-0052 largely disappeared
20130101_20130531_en_agcc-0053 as stigma has disappeared
20130101_20130531_en_agcc-0054 so has some of the focus so there is

20130101_20130531_en_agev-0002 not everyone was surprised but some of the electorate are furious the election is three weeks away
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0003 the guardian council of the constitution have shortlisted eight figures who will be allowed to run for office in the presidential elections most to conservative supreme leader ali
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0004 only two of them are pro reform
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0006 his advanced may be seen an impediment to his continuing a political career
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0007 the the guardian council
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0008 is very old the presidency requires a high level of
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0009 rafsanjani registering as a candidate at the last minute upset many political factions and ruined their plans
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0010 outgoing president
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0011 two thousand nine victory claim in a vote his opponents said was rigged
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0015 which brought a huge number of them to the scene today it has been a bit damaged
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0016 this should be our sacred objective not necessary in the current circumstances keep some people in prison for alleged activities they should be allowed to rejoin their families
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0017 rafsanjani was speaker of parliament for nine years from eighty-nine ninety-seven he was president of iran alongside supreme leader ayatollah ali
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0019 in two thousand five he made a bid to to the presidency but was decisively beaten by
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0021 an
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0022 in the council of guardians has
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0025 rafsanjani has had a very important role in the formation of the islamic republic yet in spite of this was disqualified how you see
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0026 this
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0028 at least until his second term as president he was one of the top decision makers of the regime
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0029 after that he has held posts as head of the expediency council and head of the house of experts and these are very important posts in the islamic republic
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0031 is afraid that his sphere of power is shrinking
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0032 and that it no longer extends to cover all the figures and the main body of the regime
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0033 therefore he is either trying to delete the part of the
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0034 does not abide by his wishes or
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0035 to limit core of the system to those he can still trust and rule
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0036 some social and political personalities including daughter ayatollah khomeini the founder of the islamic republic have asked the leader to intervene and a state to bring rafsanjani into the elections probable do you think that is
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0037 the chances are very small
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0038 even if that happened rafsanjani finally got through
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0040 be in debt to
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0041 whose policies have so far
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0042 prevented the political sphere from opening up
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0043 have prevented cooperation with the west
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0045 and have made cooperation
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0049 it was thought that outgoing
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0050 ahmadinejad
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0053 those concerns may still be there as far as we know the guardian council has decided firmly it is a risk worth taking
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0055 and pay the price at this stage
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0057 he wants to rule over a homogeneous regime
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0058 of course i think that whichever presidential candidate comes to power will still have the same with the leader as
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0059 the system will not become homogeneous

20130101_20130531_en_agew-0005 some insects like bees and dragonflies have lenses in their eyes which both close up and panoramic

20130101_20130531_en_agfw-0027 for me has
20130101_20130531_en_agfw-0028 because it was
20130101_20130531_en_agfw-0029 this beautiful

20130101_20130531_en_agfy-0002 but businesses continue to suffer from a lack of new orders which should inhibit any meaningful near term recovery as a result the region is likely to remain in recession in the quarter of
20130101_20130531_en_agfy-0003 surveys
20130101_20130531_en_agfy-0004 of companies both in the manufacturing and the services sector pointed a similar contraction the

20130101_20130531_en_agga-0004 is stalling the soft data is a problem for top politicians trying to manage the economy in such a way there is an orderly slowdown
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0001 the president of the european central bank jean
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0002 consider the results of efforts to stabilise the
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0003 and if he still thinks the eurozone is taking the right medicine
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0004 are austerity policies really the best
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0005 or as some economists saying are they simply an application of counterproductive
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0006 i believe that words count
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0007 we talk about austerity as much in the united states in england or even in japan
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0008 in a country with a very big current account payment deficit
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0009 like greece or other countries which are in
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0010 the term austerity i is inappropriate
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0011 there is a need for
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0012 healthy management
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0013 when one is spending than one is earning
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0014 for what reason
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0016 eternally ready to finance the countries that spend more than their income
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0017 the
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0018 and it seems to me that sound management is the best way to lay the groundwork for future growth and job creation in future
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0019 we get impression that on the chess board europe seems to stand alone with its obsession for public accounts
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0021 there is major
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0022 debate in united states
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0023 over whether the first thing to do is to place the stress on putting the public finances into working order
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0024 or not
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0025 this is also under debate in england austerity or growth
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0026 europe is still the epicentre of the global crisis of
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0027 debt risk and therefore budget crises
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0028 unfortunately that is partly its own fault because in some cases it was negligent
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0029 it was and still is if i may say
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0030 but i think we still have to look at things clearly
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0031 europe has made enormous progress
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0032 it is still very
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0033 of this crisis
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0034 but it has distanced the risk of catastrophe thanks to the decisions it has taken governments the european institutions and the central bank
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0035 therefore we are now at a stage where we absolutely must consolidate everything which might permit a return to growth
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0036 what lesson can we from the greek or cypriot crisis perhaps some economies were too feeble to be into the euro zone or are the stronger euro zone economies not ready to pay a high cost to protect the poorer members
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0037 first of all saying that countries are necessarily richer or poorer is
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0038 you know
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0039 our problem today is that there are countries
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0040 fortunately relatively numerous that are competitive that sell their goods and services comfortably on the domestic european and world markets
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0041 and have good reasons for that because they have a good grip on their costs and structural
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0042 reforms
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0043 and then there are countries that have mastered their costs far less well and which have not reformed structurally
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0044 and these countries are evidently in difficulty
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0045 so i believe that the great lesson is that there has to be a staggering improvement in the economic and budgetary governance
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0046 of the whole
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0047 it has to be very firm when this or that becomes dangerous to itself and to the entire zone
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0048 are you in favour of a european economic and budgetary federation what should its criteria
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0049 and do you
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0050 that would be a realistic route for europe to take today
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0051 i do we to go further along the of a
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0052 budgetary federation
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0053 obviously would mean new change in the treaties
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0054 personally i there several possibilities to consider
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0057 but i think it fulfils three criteria
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0058 one it is efficient which i will develop for you
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0059 two it is democratic
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0060 and three it respects the principle of subsidiarity
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0061 these three things essential to
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0062 if a country manages its affairs very badly
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0063 does not respect
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0064 made to it by european commission and the
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0066 as we have amply in the crisis
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0067 then there are sanctions that are supposed to act as a deterrent sanctions in the form of
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0069 instead what i myself as realistically imaginable is instead of fines
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0070 activate a
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0071 decision process at the level of the european institutions taken together
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0072 the commission plays the role of government it anticipates a government
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0073 the council of governments is a sort of upper chamber a senate
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0074 and the european parliament with its members elected by direct universal suffrage
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0075 and who be elected in the next european poll
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0076 act as the lower chamber
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0077 i suggest that the commission say here is what needs to be done
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0078 the senate the upper chamber think about
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0079 and then say to the european
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0081 then the european parliament decides evidently limited to representatives of the euro zone and after contact with the national parliaments
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0083 but they respect the principle of subsidiarity because this is not applied generally it would only be in absolutely exceptional cases and when the stability of the whole is in question
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0085 the ultimate decision is taken by representatives of the people and that makes it relatively certain that these are not just empty words
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0086 and this not an ineffective dissuasive measure of
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0087 is an alignment being formed in europe notably with france italy and spain who are adopting an approach of reasoning by dialogue with the policy german chancellor angela merkel
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0088 do you see that
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0090 i am too deeply attached to the friendship among europeans
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0091 and of course friendship between france and germany
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0092 to either rule out or see that beyond this or that agitation
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0093 there is a real will to move forward together
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0094 and a real will to overcome the difficulties
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0095 that europe has encountered systematically
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0096 that it has dealt with and responded to a way that is indisputable when we look at everything that has been done at this terribly difficult time
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0001 there
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0003 at a bangladesh clothing factory to ensure such a disaster does not happen again
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0004 global union brings together nine hundred unions representing fifteen million workers worldwide has been pushing for
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0005 in the grips of a
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0009 manufacturing and services and the commerce sector
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0010 on
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0011 fire
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0012 factory safety in bangladesh
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0013 is an agreement with a difference
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0014 it a legally binding enforceable agreement
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0015 we have more than forty of the major retail global brands signed up to legally binding agreement this matters this is different and this is going to have an impact
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0016 all those european consumers even in the midst of a recession even at a time of squeeze are you prepared to pay penny or
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0017 more
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0018 to have the assurance of the products are buying are not built on the
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0020 and make a new reality in bangladesh and other countries
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0021 bangladesh and other countries this agreement implicates
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0022 why you get retailers to sign up to an agreement in all the countries they operate in
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0023 one of the issues going to have to discuss is how do we this a broader based agreement but given the factory collapse
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0024 given the fact that
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0025 more than two lives have been lost in bangladesh given that in bangladesh this is a sector employing four million people in four factories that was the critical issue but help is coming and help is on the way for all of those other countries i think it is inevitable that we broaden discussion
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0028 had some big names signing up
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0029 calvin klein
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0030 but some notable absences who
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0031 the notable
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0032 is in the united states of america we do have abercrombie fitch we have calvin klein we tommy
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0033 and we many other big global names but principally
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0034 from the european union countries is a very good thing but
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0036 supermarket chain is walmart they employ two million people they are the supply chain experts they know how to
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0038 be their own judge and jury they are the new flag of convenience to themselves in this process and
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0039 as well gap
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0040 likes to present itself trendy contemporary responsible i know going on in gap
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0043 honestly
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0044 the sense missing here
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0045 is glenn murphy the ceo gap
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0046 and the of directors of walmart
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0047 and
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0048 absence of any sense of gravitas consequence by the national
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0049 they are being
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0050 by walmart bullied by gap
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0052 more acquiescent to their demands
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0053 isabelle we have a broad coalition
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0054 of retail brands household names
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0056 hang on a minute have you seen the of companies that have signed up for this agreement
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0057 have you seen the names do you read them all out to all your listeners
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0059 you or your listeners or viewers get the impression that this is somehow a marginal event that it have a critical mass that
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0060 is a side show
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0061 look the retail brands have had decades to get this
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0062 and we are no longer going to accept these
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0063 agreements
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0064 are not properly enforceable where there is no transparency all we get vague promises yes things will improve
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0065 only got time for one more question
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0066 and that comes from the united
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0067 and the
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0068 the
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0069 do more to improve labour standards bangladesh
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0070 will the pledge become
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0072 take appropriate action what doing to make sure action does take place the eu level
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0073 well it sounds like cold tea to me
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0074 the european union making a wishy washy statement about we must do more to implement improve labour standards in bangladesh is not enough
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0075 i think mister barroso mister
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0076 and mister
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0078 global union to ensure this applied the european union has to stop the race to the bottom
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0079 and what we have seen is the human tragedy and consequences
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0080 of this race to the bottom where basically these bangladeshi workers are surviving on thirty-eight dollars a
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0083 winds in our sails by making it clear
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0084 to the retail industry which after all is the
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0085 private sector employer in europe that the goods that they sell are being produced in fair
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0086 factories under fair and safe conditions
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0087 that when we cross the threshold of every shop we do so as consumers with a
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0088 that this at the end of the day is making the world of turn turn for business but at the end of the day for the people who are toiling in intolerable conditions that they will get a better life

20130101_20130531_en_agge-0007 we are still the last line of defence against any
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0008 especially we are really close to the station
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0009 the time would for the ground to send a command to that machine in case something goes wrong would be too late

20130101_20130531_en_agge-0023 what i do monitor the distance
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0024 with a ruler making sure that what i see and what the computer thinks he
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0025 are the same
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0026 i also check its rate
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0028 delay or completely abort
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0029 the astronauts are watched closely as they
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0030 and then watched as they work if a european is in space there is always someone in cologne to keep a careful eye
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0031 their health status the
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0032 the technical systems that maintain their
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0033 the astronauts on the international space station follow steady pre defined rhythm of work and rest to make sure get

20130101_20130531_en_agge-0042 work
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0043 the hands and eyes of the scientists on the ground
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0044 orbital experiments
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0045 and
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0046 part of that experiment their bodies and minds studied and recorded we explore how humans adapt to in space
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0048 during and after
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0049 the total energy
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0050 of a
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0051 astronaut
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0052 on a long term spaceflight on the ground and
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0053 in
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0054 goal is to
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0055 optimise food allotments for example for long term spaceflights and to better understand what the really needs on long term spaceflights
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0056 the
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0057 basic research to
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0058 understand
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0059 the principles and the regulation mechanism in obesity
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0060 the long term of agencies like esa
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0061 is for astronauts to travel further into space for longer periods of time
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0062 for reason one of the central of research is to understand how our body reacts to living in zero
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0063 as
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0064 the
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0065 the lack of gravity
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0066 negatively impacts our muscular system our skeletal system
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0068 that is certainly
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0069 the only hope to maintain muscle and bone is to do exercise cycling jogging and weightlifting
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0070 the bones of an astronaut who spends six months in space will take six months to recover
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0071 the biggest physical
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0073 to adapt to weightlessness
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0074 but coming back is even worse you have to adapt to the planet
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0075 to gravity
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0076 so
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0077 you become earth sick
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0078 have problems with
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0079 muscle soreness for three months had muscle
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0081 not enough for small muscles for example in your
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0083 so
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0084 for three months i had muscle
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0085 another occupational hazard of life in orbit is
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0086 space itself and all the highly charged particles of radiation that bombard the
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0087 of course very well aware the long term medical effects that space flight have yes you have a higher level of radiation there
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0088 in a six month space flight
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0089 you
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0090 about the same type of radiation or level of radiation as worker in a nuclear factory during his entire career
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0091 that kind of radiation exposure could lead to cancers such as leukemia but for the moment the medical team to find any long term effects of spaceflight
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0092 we continue to monitor the astronauts over long period of time
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0093 retirement and even beyond we
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0094 the astronauts all the data worldwide of all astronauts put into a database we try
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0095 to identify specific medical issues that be related to the occupation of an
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0096 an occupation with risks also huge rewards and the view from the window is this a
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0097 the
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0098 that
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0099 that are good friends i was their backup
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0100 a few months ago
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0101 they just tell me all the time that time flies
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0102 it is such an incredible experience
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0103 six months go by in the blink of an so
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0104 the biggest concern is to try and make it count for every second to create memories while they are up there
20130101_20130531_en_aggf-0002 stricter disciplinary regulations were rubber stamped by
20130101_20130531_en_aggf-0003 executive committee on thursday in london ahead of the champions league final on saturday
20130101_20130531_en_aggf-0004 i think the message is
20130101_20130531_en_aggf-0005 we are fighting against
20130101_20130531_en_aggf-0006 racism
20130101_20130531_en_aggf-0007 in an efficient and if a player
20130101_20130531_en_aggf-0008 is
20130101_20130531_en_aggf-0009 in a racist way
20130101_20130531_en_aggf-0010 clubs would also face closure of stadiums for a first incident of racist abuse by fans and a full closure for a second offence the new sanctions only apply matches in european competition although is domestic leagues will adopt the same punishments soon
20130101_20130531_en_aggg-0001 the who talked to attackers has
20130101_20130531_en_aggg-0002 is originally from
20130101_20130531_en_aggg-0003 and is a cub scout leader she
20130101_20130531_en_aggg-0004 well i saw a man on the road obviously injured and car crashed so i assumed was a road accident when i approached
20130101_20130531_en_aggg-0005 the body was a lady cradling
20130101_20130531_en_aggg-0006 and then guy the
20130101_20130531_en_aggg-0009 this axe the butchers have to
20130101_20130531_en_aggg-0010 he had and blood all over him and i thought
20130101_20130531_en_aggg-0011 the heck
20130101_20130531_en_aggg-0012 and
20130101_20130531_en_aggg-0014 said why a british soldier
20130101_20130531_en_aggg-0015 in countries and have nothing to
20130101_20130531_en_aggg-0016 to make him talk about
20130101_20130531_en_aggg-0017 he felt
20130101_20130531_en_aggg-0018 you
20130101_20130531_en_aggg-0019 in
20130101_20130531_en_aggg-0020 better me than a child
20130101_20130531_en_aggg-0021 because
20130101_20130531_en_aggg-0022 there more and more mothers with children stopping around by so it was even more and more important
20130101_20130531_en_aggg-0023 i talked to him
20130101_20130531_en_aggg-0024 asking what wanted
20130101_20130531_en_aggh-0001 soldier died near the woolwich
20130101_20130531_en_aggh-0002 in southeast london

20130101_20130531_en_aghm-0001 germany only just avoided falling into recession in the first three months of this year thanks to a rise in private consumption gdp by

20130101_20130531_en_aghn-0006 the national education system is also
20130101_20130531_en_aghn-0007 there have always also been privately run islamic schools
20130101_20130531_en_aghn-0008 until last year however it was harder to get into university from an islamic school than from a state
20130101_20130531_en_aghn-0009 but now
20130101_20130531_en_aghn-0010 islamic schools have become more popular
20130101_20130531_en_aghn-0011 the number of religious in turkey is increasing all the time but some people are questions about the role of religion in education and the goals of some of these religious schools
20130101_20130531_en_aghn-0012 schools
20130101_20130531_en_aghn-0013 and

20130101_20130531_en_aghn-0015 on a secular school curriculum
20130101_20130531_en_aghn-0016 but whether islamic schools are simply a way of preserving cultural traditions or whether they have another agenda remains a topic of debate
20130101_20130531_en_aghn-0017 meanwhile educationalists point out that improving teacher training and education
20130101_20130531_en_aghn-0018 is the highest priority

20130101_20130531_en_agho-0001 the weather in western europe this month could easily have been mistaken for mid winter
20130101_20130531_en_agho-0002 the french mountain community of little saint very close to the border with italy in the alps the snow ploughs have been out daily
20130101_20130531_en_agho-0003 they can keep the road clear
20130101_20130531_en_agho-0004 the serra de estrela in the middle of portugal
20130101_20130531_en_agho-0005 the last time they had snow there this late in the year was eight years ago
20130101_20130531_en_agho-0006 strange but i think the whole of europe had a very long
20130101_20130531_en_agho-0008 in may
20130101_20130531_en_agho-0009 the spanish city of burgos felt temperatures drop to three on may fifteen
20130101_20130531_en_agho-0011 this has meant a five ten percent rise in electricity consumption compared to previous years similarly for combustible pellets
20130101_20130531_en_agho-0014 germany steady wind driven downpours caused damaging floods
20130101_20130531_en_agho-0015 on eighteen may almost forty-seven litres of rain fell per square metre
20130101_20130531_en_agho-0017 rice farmers were
20130101_20130531_en_agho-0018 one early estimates are that we may lose thirty percent of the crop maybe more if this goes on a lot of farmers even get to their fields to plant seed
20130101_20130531_en_agho-0020 cafe and bar terraces were like an aquarium businesses and holiday planners are left wondering will western europe get a proper summer after all this
20130101_20130531_en_agho-0021 to find
20130101_20130531_en_agho-0022 spoke to the royal belgian institute meteorology jean marc linden is
20130101_20130531_en_agho-0023 have we ever had such a terrible spring and why is this happening
20130101_20130531_en_agho-0024 unfortunately we still have cold airstreams the reason
20130101_20130531_en_agho-0025 is that the we have an anticyclone over the middle of the atlantic ocean that is channelling depressions via iceland directly to western europe
20130101_20130531_en_agho-0026 these are cold airstreams often disturbed often unstable so we will keep getting below normal temperatures today for example we are seeing a temperature ten degrees celsius the average for this season and
20130101_20130531_en_agho-0027 is going to be like that until the end of the month
20130101_20130531_en_agho-0028 the cold airstream is being pushed
20130101_20130531_en_agho-0029 from the poles to the benelux countries france parts of
20130101_20130531_en_agho-0030 section of cold stream has become detached
20130101_20130531_en_agho-0031 this is what is called a cold drop
20130101_20130531_en_agho-0033 it is like a see saw
20130101_20130531_en_agho-0034 right now one part of europe is warm while we are on the not so good side
20130101_20130531_en_agho-0035 here is the million euro question
20130101_20130531_en_agho-0036 a horrible spring
20130101_20130531_en_agho-0037 the summer
20130101_20130531_en_agho-0038 this the question every meteorologist dream of answering there is no link between a cold spring and a summer or the opposite atmospheric circulation means you can experience many different weather conditions in a relatively short time
20130101_20130531_en_agho-0039 you could get subtropical conditions developing mean temperatures of around twenty-five thirty degrees for france and the benelux countries
20130101_20130531_en_agho-0040 but to get this we would need an anticyclone over the centre of europe bulgaria example and then we here would have rising hot air which would last three weeks
20130101_20130531_en_agho-0042 to say going to happen
20130101_20130531_en_aghp-0001 the
20130101_20130531_en_aghp-0003 is known in these parts is

20130101_20130531_en_aghp-0005 notorious for shooting fast the hip albeit with unforgiving words as opposed to unforgiving pistols hunts mercilessly after one target and one target
20130101_20130531_en_aghp-0007 we want to stop those political euro rescue actions and break up the eurozone the euro is dividing europe instead of unifying it we want to stop those multi euro payments in favour of southern european countries those payments are deepening the crisis
20130101_20130531_en_aghp-0008 only founded
20130101_20130531_en_aghp-0011 outfit
20130101_20130531_en_aghp-0013 he set off alone they backed the euro rescue
20130101_20130531_en_aghp-0015 now one in three germans want a return to the deutsche mark while one in four have sympathy for the argument that the southern european dept
20130101_20130531_en_aghp-0016 will sink germany in the future
20130101_20130531_en_aghp-0017 only three percent of germans are expected to vote for party in
20130101_20130531_en_aghp-0018 elections but the lone shooter is confident this will stretch to two digits such is momentum
20130101_20130531_en_aghp-0019 even with less votes could dislodge government
20130101_20130531_en_aghp-0020 this
20130101_20130531_en_aghp-0021 the
20130101_20130531_en_aghp-0022 that
20130101_20130531_en_aghp-0023 up now germany has not lost a single cent let alone a euro from its bailout actions an economic adviser to the government
20130101_20130531_en_aghp-0024 is adamant stepping out altogether take country down a ruinous path
20130101_20130531_en_aghp-0025 closing the eurozone would be an enormous shock insecurity comparable to the shock would trigger very significant negative effects for investors change
20130101_20130531_en_aghp-0026 create enormous problems for the whole financial system

20130101_20130531_en_aght-0020 the mistake was rushing into a single currency before creating the necessary institutional mechanisms
20130101_20130531_en_aght-0021 that
20130101_20130531_en_aght-0022 is not to be easy because to very brave decisions in particular when forming the
20130101_20130531_en_aght-0023 banking union and the fiscal union which i think we need
20130101_20130531_en_aght-0024 but they need to be done because if they are not done then the currency will be holding back growth rather than helping it which was the original idea
20130101_20130531_en_aght-0026 to create growth
20130101_20130531_en_aght-0027 europe can sell is

20130101_20130531_en_aght-0030 we need to make sure we

20130101_20130531_en_aght-0034 authority national self interest was the problem and partnership is the prescription
20130101_20130531_en_aght-0035 we have to look at energy policy one of the things
20130101_20130531_en_aght-0036 does not
20130101_20130531_en_aght-0037 is a strong energy
20130101_20130531_en_aght-0038 nationalistic situation
20130101_20130531_en_aght-0039 each country thinks it has its own solution
20130101_20130531_en_aght-0040 in fact energy is something that we
20130101_20130531_en_aght-0041 together if we were to share different forms of energy if we were to construct grids that worked across
20130101_20130531_en_aght-0042 europe we could lower the price of energy to the consumer if we lower the price of energy to the consumer
20130101_20130531_en_aght-0044 almost goading those european
20130101_20130531_en_aght-0045 the forum took place in the capital kazakhstan a country currently experiencing massive growth thanks its hydrocarbon reserves
20130101_20130531_en_aght-0046 floating on an exhalation of petrodollars kazakhstan has been identified as one of
20130101_20130531_en_aght-0047 nations might actually benefit from rapidly changing global economy
20130101_20130531_en_aghu-0001 how about one european
20130101_20130531_en_aghu-0002 i can see at two benefits for eu member states you can cut defence and speak as one voice the diplomatic scene what do you think
20130101_20130531_en_aghu-0003 things are a little more
20130101_20130531_en_aghu-0004 than
20130101_20130531_en_aghu-0005 just because to have one european you need to have a common foreign policy
20130101_20130531_en_aghu-0006 when the un held its vote on the recognition of palestine european states were divided
20130101_20130531_en_aghu-0007 they also divided on the recognition of kosovo
20130101_20130531_en_aghu-0009 then we need to have a common understanding of how to use our armed forces
20130101_20130531_en_aghu-0010 here we can take the example of mali where the french are heavily involved where there no other european with troops on the ground even if some are offering logistical support
20130101_20130531_en_aghu-0011 finally we can look back at the practical lessons we have experienced in the past
20130101_20130531_en_aghu-0012 for example in eighty-nine the creation of franco german brigade was a highly integrated example of what was a kind of mini european
20130101_20130531_en_aghu-0013 almost immediately we found ourselves
20130101_20130531_en_aghu-0014 with several very very practical problems the french and germans did not speak
20130101_20130531_en_aghu-0015 and
20130101_20130531_en_aghu-0016 the french and german soldiers english
20130101_20130531_en_aghu-0017 the statutes of the german not the same as the articles of the french
20130101_20130531_en_aghu-0018 in regard their right to express concern or to state pensions
20130101_20130531_en_aghu-0019 today europe has three different types fighter plans around six different kinds of frigates and seventeen different kind of tanks naturally when there are so many different types of military apparatus it is not ideal for interoperability between armies
20130101_20130531_en_aghu-0020 then you will ask me is true things
20130101_20130531_en_aghu-0021 and i would say things are moving very slowly
20130101_20130531_en_aghu-0022 if you to ask a question

20130101_20130531_en_agko-0031 many things our way of life
20130101_20130531_en_agko-0032 and the mysterious russian soul
20130101_20130531_en_agko-0035 whatever the destination for those with spirit for adventure the trans siberian trip a russian speciality not to miss
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0001 our basic rights has become a top
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0002 many europeans and that was supposed strengthen those freedoms was the
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0003 charter of fundamental rights which came into force thousand
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0004 just on paper or something that can
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0005 action on the ground
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0006 the charter brings together a wide range of principles into one document and raising awareness about how it can be used effectively is a key challenge
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0007 it is legally binding on eu states but only when they apply european law
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0008 and must also be
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0009 by the institutions of the bloc
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0010 to the belgian capital to talk to some of those most likely to come the charter in their work
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0011 european officials maintain the
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0012 is already becoming a reality for people whose rights are under attack
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0013 to put that to the test caught up with some workers at a new independent legal help centre set up in january
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0014 the eu rights clinic is a joint venture between the ngo european citizen action service and kent university in brussels
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0018 and if i need to understand certain aspects of a problem and have more of a general look at things
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0019 well then yes i will look at the charter of fundamental rights
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0021 we can use as a reference for legal services in so far as giving legal advice to people in order to them as as in our advocacy
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0022 in a new progress report on the charter the european commission says national courts are increasingly referring to the document
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0023 it highlights the case where the austrian constitutional
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0024 ruled that people can rely on the charter when challenging local legislation
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0025 says the number of cases where the eu court of justice has quoted the text in its judgements almost doubled last year
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0026 infringement proceedings against malta and hungary are also given as examples of where the principles of the charter have been
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0027 the report also shows what fundamental rights issues were most raised correspondence with the european commission
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0028 top of the list was freedom of movement and residence followed by the functioning of national justice systems and access to justice then the right to choose an occupation and work
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0029 the integration of disabled people the protection of personal data
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0030 but still it seems a lot has to be to make sure the charter is better understood and more widely used
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0031 rights organisations argue that while it a crucial document the question of exactly who is bound by it and under circumstances remains difficult to work
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0033 there are more more national courts that refer to the charter
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0036 the charter will soon move in other directions coming into force in croatia for example when it joins the eu in july
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0037 a volunteer at the european citizen service has been helping prepare for the accession
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0038 there are some doubts in croatia
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0039 that this charter will diminish the role of croatian courts but i think
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0040 those doubts are
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0041 not relevant so
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0043 eu accession will bring
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0044 more democracy and more
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0045 protection the rights of the citizens

20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0047 his case is being examined
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0048 experts we should all be better informed

20130101_20130531_en_agks-0013 former lebanese prime minister fuad siniora has made this a clear accusation

20130101_20130531_en_agow-0005 i was scared of guess what you would call stage fright
20130101_20130531_en_agow-0006 tonight i did what i have been terrified of doing ever since was twenty years old
20130101_20130531_en_agow-0007 and i played classical in concert
20130101_20130531_en_agow-0008 my first was to play the music of bach because his fits
20130101_20130531_en_agow-0009 with the accordion
20130101_20130531_en_agow-0010 sometimes i even feel as if bach were written for the accordion
20130101_20130531_en_agow-0011 playing the part that is usually played by the flute the oboe or the harpsichord
20130101_20130531_en_agow-0012 then i turned to vivaldi this was because even though vivaldi is very difficult to play even on the violin the accordion has great range
20130101_20130531_en_agow-0013 bach
20130101_20130531_en_agow-0015 with music well known you have to take risk to get the most out of it
20130101_20130531_en_agow-0018 was influenced by vivaldi and developed the same structure in his tango
20130101_20130531_en_agow-0019 here we find the same format the same search for melody
20130101_20130531_en_agow-0022 at the time i had a chamber orchestra so i invited richard to play some classical pieces with us
20130101_20130531_en_agow-0023 i think it was more less his experience this
20130101_20130531_en_agow-0024 i was a fan
20130101_20130531_en_agow-0025 and we the of creating a tango
20130101_20130531_en_agow-0026 so started writing transcripts for a set
20130101_20130531_en_agow-0029 its normal to play classical accordion in russia for
20130101_20130531_en_agow-0030 in the west we were a bit behind the russians on
20130101_20130531_en_agow-0031 but i think good thing that a big star like
20130101_20130531_en_agow-0032 shows how well the accordion can work with bach or vivaldi

20130101_20130531_en_agqf-0004 weather was also factor fall in consumer spending
20130101_20130531_en_agqf-0005 in april consumption dipped
20130101_20130531_en_agqf-0006 three percent from march
20130101_20130531_en_agqf-0007 the decline was less than expected and car sales actually rose by one eight percent from the previous month household spending accounts for more than half of economic output in france and it needs to pick up to revive the economy which slipped into recession in the first quarter

20130101_20130531_en_agqg-0013 in
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0004 the terms were such that we really feel we were used as a test model
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0005 it that this encouraged
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0006 eu officials
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0007 and many governments
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0008 to see this as a good solution for the future
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0009 reach something better through a banking union
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0010 the international monetary in its annual
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0011 sketches out what is coming for the cypriot economy it says that from fifteen to eighteen additional disciplinary measures equivalent to four seven percent of the annual income of cyprus
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0012 your plan so that people can have some hope
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0014 for example during discussions which aimed at avoiding the bailout
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0015 even in the resolution
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0016 they did not take natural resources into consideration
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0017 i believe that the keys to
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0019 will lie in cooperation over natural gas
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0020 that we are pursuing with israel the strengthening of relations and co exploitation in some
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0023 the
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0024 problem was bad management by the bankers
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0025 the banking sector in relation to gdp was not many times larger
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0027 that not the problem
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0028 unfortunately sometimes we get big
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0029 and we mismanage our capacity
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0030 a very healthy banking system was led to the of collapse endangering us with default on our national commitments
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0031 of course there were also mistakes made in providing liquidity for one of the two banks
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0032 the popular bank
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0033 which went bankrupt and merged with the bank cyprus absorbed nine
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0034 billion euros of european central bank emergency liquidity assistance
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0035 that is how much the state of cyprus needs
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0036 if you take this into account you realise there are grounds for blame
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0037 just referred to the management of the banking sector and to the bankers what is in your dispute with the central bank of
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0038 what is important now is to work together and not in confrontation
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0039 not to think that the european system of independent central banks opposes mutual respect
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0040 the system is indisputable and we totally respect
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0041 it
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0042 however the actions of central bank governors affect the policies of elected governments
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0043 therefore there should be mutual respect between an elected leadership and an independent appointed official
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0046 these have moved subject back up the agenda to discuss a new solution
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0049 i have to say that it is nothing but description of what was done from two thousand eight until twelve
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0051 but it is not in any way a basis on which we are going to pursue the negotiations nor we are bound by any convergence which was successfully accomplished in past
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0052 you saying that when the negotiations start up again you are not going to begin from the point where you left them
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0054 the
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0055 is a bi communal zone federation with political
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0058 nobody can define our sovereign rights and connect them to our national solution we do want a solution we want liberation we want reunification with peaceful co existence
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0059 we seek prosperity for everyone
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0062 israel what exactly came out of visit
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0063 we speak about new cooperative relations or a new diplomatic
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0064 has already decided to create facility to liquefy gas
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0065 is very important
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0066 it help israel
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0067 allowing it to export through this facility
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0068 rather than the suez canal in another direction
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0069 the
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0070 to europe is
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0071 and the exclusive economic zones of cyprus and israel
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0072 are so close in distance
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0073 this also could help the
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0074 alliance that we seek
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0075 to conclude what would you the people of cyprus we all know they are suffering and expecting hard times ahead
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0076 i trust the cypriots they are very well educated
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0077 in cyprus we may combine high
