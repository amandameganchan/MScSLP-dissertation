# ORIG TITLE    Italy’s new PM: ‘Balanced’ or a ‘sell-out’, reactions from Rome . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Italian President Giorgio Napolitano has chosen Democratic Party number 2, Enrico Letta to form a government as the new prime minister. Outside the presidential palace in Rome, Italians reacted to the news. A visiting tourist felt he was the only man for the job. ‘‘Enrico Letta is the least bad option among those who had been proposed for the job,” she said. One of the candidates, two-times Prime Minister Giuliano Amato, 74, had initially been one of the favourites for the post. But tourist Alessandra Mori felt this was an even worse option: . One resident of Rome felt that Letta had sold out: “I am not happy. In fact I am here to show my disappointment. Even if I don’t see many others doing the same.” . One of Europe’s youngest leaders, Europhile and anti-austerity, Letta clearly appeals across party lines. This will come in handy when finding a coalition government to lead Italy out of its economic funk.
