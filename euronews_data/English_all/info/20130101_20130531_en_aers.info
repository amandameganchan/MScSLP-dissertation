# ORIG TITLE    Nuclear showdown continues as North Korea issues list of demands . 
# ORIG CONTENT  North Korea has issued a list of conditions in the latest development in their nuclear showdown. The US has offered talks only if Pyongyang drops its nuclear ambitions. They greeted the offer with a counter offer as the North Korean news service reports. “They should retract the UN Security Council’s “resolutions on sanctions. They should bear in mind that the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula can only begin with the pullout  of the nuclear weapons introduced by the US and this could lead to global denuclearisation.” . The move by North Korea comes as neighbouring China has expressed its unease with the escalating nuclear threats. US Secretary of State John Kerry was in China recently asking for them to put pressure on their main trading partner to scale back their rhetoric. Seoul also attempted to start talks regarding the Kaesong region in the North where South Korean workers at an industrial complex remain isolated as the borders remain closed to incomers from the South. The proposal was met with hostility.
