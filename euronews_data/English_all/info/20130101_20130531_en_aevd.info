# ORIG TITLE    Vettel makes it two in a row in Bahrain . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Exactly the same result as last year at the Bahrain grand prix, won by Sebastien Vettel with Kimi Raikonnen second and Romain Grosjean third. It was world champion Vettel’s second win of the season, and Raikonnen’s 21st scoring finish in a row. The race was untroubled by the anti-government protests and civil unrest that has raged elsewhere in the tiny Gulf kingdom. Nico Rosberg, who held pole position, could only finish ninth just behind Fernando Alonso. Lewis Hamilton took fifth, just behind Paul di Resta, the best-placed Briton. Vettel now has 77 points to second-placed Raikonnen’s 67 in the driver’s championship. Hamilton is third on 50, followed by Alonso and Mark Webber. In the constructors’ championship Red Bull are out in front, but Lotus’s double on Sunday lifts them into second ahead of Ferrari. Mercedes are fourth, and Force India have overtaken McLaren.
