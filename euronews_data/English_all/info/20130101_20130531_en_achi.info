# ORIG TITLE    Tunisia in search of a new government . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Tunisia’s Interior Minister Ali Larayedh has been asked by the president to form a government within two weeks. He has been formally nominated to succeed outgoing Prime Minister Hamadi Jebali who resigned on Tuesday. Speaking immediately after his nomination, Larayedh promised to hold talks in order to form an administration that will govern for all Tunisians. But critics say the ruling party Ennahda’s choice for prime minister will only aggravate tensions and increase widespread anger. The nomination also raised hackles among opposition parties, some of whom accuse Larayedh’s Interior Ministry of failing to curb Islamist violence, although he is credited with acting firmly against al Qaeda-linked militants. Tunisia was plunged into a political crisis two weeks ago when the assassination of secular opposition politician Chokri Belaid ignited the biggest street protests since the overthrow of strongman Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali two years ago. No one has claimed responsibility for Belaid’s killing. Although many blame the government, it has denied any involvement in his death.
