# ORIG CONTENT  ABC correspondent Brandi Hitt, who was on the red carpet in Los Angeles for the Oscars, spoke to Euronews about the event. This year, one award was never in any real doubt – Daniel Day-Lewis won a Best Actor Oscar for his role in Lincoln and made Hollywood history by becoming the first to win 3 Best Actor Academy Awards. Ben Affleck’s political thriller Argo won the Best Film award although he wasn’t nominated for Best Director, an award that was won by Ang Lee for his dazzling version of the Life of Pi – which had been regarded as unfilmable. Michael Haneke’s Armour won the Best Foreign Language film, although it had also been nominated in the Best Picture category. Jennifer Lawrence won Best Actress for Silver Linings Playbook, and Best Supporting Actress went as expected to Anne Hathaway for Les Miserables. Christoph Waltz took home the Best Supporting Actor award, for Django Unchained.
