# ORIG TITLE    Pope Francis wants tough action on Church sex abuse . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Determined to end a problem that has engulfed the Catholic Church for over a decade, Pope Francis has said he wants sexual abuse to be dealt with “decisively”. Pope Francis has sent out a clear message that he wants clerical abusers to face appropriate justice and past and present victims to be helped. The Pontiff has met with the man in charge of the Church department that investigates sex crimes, Archbishop Gerhard Mueller who heads the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. A victims’ group – Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests – or SNAP said the Pope’s words did not go far enough. The group criticised the Pontiff and called his stance a continuation of that of his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI. The Church has been repeatedly accused of previously covering up for priests found guilty of abusing children.
