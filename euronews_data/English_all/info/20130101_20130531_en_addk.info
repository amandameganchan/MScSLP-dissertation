# ORIG TITLE    ALMA set to reveal the Universe . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Mankind has a new eye on the heavens today with the inauguration of the worldâ€™s largest telescope in Chile. The ALMA array is high in the Atacama desert, 5000 metres above sea level. Once fully operational its 66 radio antennas spread over a 10-kilometre radius for maximum efficiency will be able to probe deeper into the universe than ever before, and with a resolution 10 times sharper than the orbiting Hubble telescope.
