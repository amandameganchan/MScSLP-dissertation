# ORIG TITLE    Amsterdam welcomes back Van Gogh in renovated museum . 
# ORIG CONTENT  After being closed for seven months, Amsterdam’s Van Gogh Museum is welcoming visitors with a new exhibition. A 20-million euro revamp was undertaken while the building complied with strict fire safety regulations in the Netherlands, meaning guests can enjoy new works in a new surrounding. “The big change visitors will notice is the colours on the walls. Now we have darker colours all over the building. So it is blue, yellow and grey,” explained Head of Collections Head of Collections Marige Vellekoop. “There is much more to see, much more Van Gogh paintings, many more drawings, letters, artist materials, things that are usually not on view at The Van Gogh Museum,” she added. On display in “Vincent at Work” are the Dutch painter’s methods, including his paints, brushes and other tools. Visitors can also see two versions of the famous “Sunflowers” after one was borrowed from London. The final painting hung was a self portrait of the iconic artist, behind a canvas, holding a brush and palette. The Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam houses the largest collection of the nineteenth century painter’s works. 1’14 end . *** .
