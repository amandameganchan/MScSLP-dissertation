# ORIG TITLE    Lugovoi pulls out of Litvinenko inquest in London . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The prime suspect in the alleged murder of Alexander Litvinenko in London, Russian member of parliament Andrei Lugovoi, says he will not attend the inquest into the spy’s death. The former KGB officer is one of two former secret agents the British would like to question about the affair. “The British side, while calling me a criminal for all these years, has still not brought official charges against me. Not a single piece of evidence of my guilt has been made public. Everything centred on gossip and rumours. Such an approach to justice totally deprived me of an opportunity to defend my good name,” said Lugovoi in Moscow. Litvinenko was close to the exiled dissident businessman Boris Berezovsky. Both were granted asylum in Britain where, in 2006, it is alleged Lugovoi poisoned Litvinenko with radioactive polonium-210 in a cup of tea at a smart London hotel.
