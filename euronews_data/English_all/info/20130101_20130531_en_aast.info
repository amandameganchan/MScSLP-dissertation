# ORIG TITLE    EU unveils standard European driving licences . 
# ORIG CONTENT  EU countries will no longer be able to issue lifetime paper driving licences from Saturday. They will gradually be replaced with a common European credit-card style version over the next two decades. The standard format of the new card licences will make it easier for traffic police in other EU countries to read. Licences will still be handed out by national authorites, and points and fines will not be transferable from country to another. These changes will affect some 300 million people, or nearly 60 percent of the EUâ€™s population.
