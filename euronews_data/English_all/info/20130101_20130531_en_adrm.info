# ORIG TITLE    Danish researchers probe food cancer risk . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Food containing starch, heated to more than 120 degrees, causes a chemical substance which is thought to be carcinogenic. That is according to Danish researchers, who have been researching the formation of acrylamide. In cooperation with German, French and Swedish food institutes, they are now taking their findings to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). It is not the first time researchers have suspected such a link. In 2002, a Swedish researcher found acrylamide in food and strongly suspected it could be carcinogenic.
