# ORIG TITLE    UK-EU relations still divisive in Britain . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The UK in the EU has proved to be a toxic issue for past Conservative leaders. It has loomed large in the downfall of the last two Tory prime ministers – the Iron Lady Margaret Thatcher in 1990 and John Major in ’97. Those relations with the continental cousins are still being divisive. Claire Buchanan, a sales vice-president for a London company, said: “I think what we have seen in the past of couple of years kind of proves the point that it was a good thing we aren’t in the euro zone right now. We would be in real trouble if we hadn’t had the opt out clauses that we have.” . Lawyer Gordon Harris said: “It is the most misconceived and frankly facile abdication of responsibility by a prime minister you could possibly imagine. The country has to be in Europe, it will be a ruination for the economy if we do anything else and he (David Cameron) is just pandering to a minority within his own party and to the great detriment of the country. It is a disastrous decision.” . Critics in the UK fear that he has started the clock on a long period of “will-they, won’t-they” uncertainty that will do nothing but harm to the UK.
