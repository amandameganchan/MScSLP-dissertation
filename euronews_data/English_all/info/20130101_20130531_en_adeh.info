# ORIG CONTENT  Britain and France say the European Union arms embargo on the Syrian opposition must be lifted – if the rebels are to succeed in toppling the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The EU embargo has been in place since April 2011 – when the Syrian uprising was in its infancy. Speaking at an EU summit in Brussels on March 15, French President François Hollande hit out at Russia, a key Damascus ally that has vetoed measures against Assad at the United Nations: . “It is two years this catastrophe has dragged on with certain countries providing weapons to Bashar al-Assad and Russia is clearly amongst them. I believe Europe has to make this decision within the coming weeks,” Hollande said. But Russia’s Ambassador to the EU Vladimir Chizhov rejected Hollande’s claims and warned against European intervention: . “I hope that neither Paris nor London regard the situation in Syria as a proxy war against Russia. I can say that Russia is not supplying weapons as such to Syria and is not arming the Syrian forces,” Chizkov said. The Syrian National Council, an anti-Assad group, has warned that the EU must be cautious over who receives arms. Georges Chachan of the group said: . “Any delivery of weapons should continue until the opposition wins. These arms should only be given to the Free Syrian Army under the supervision of the internationally-recognised opposition.” . German Chancellor Angela Merkel cautioned that arming the rebels could “fan the flames” of the conflict. “The fact that two (EU members) . have changed their minds is not enough for 25 to follow suit,” Merkel said.
