# ORIG TITLE    Speculation hots up in Cannes . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Guillaume Canet’s film “Blood Ties” has a global all-star cast. But the French actor-director’s crime and divided loyalties saga still failed to charm the critics when it was presented out of competition at the Cannes festival. The second week is well underway and there are already murmurs about the top prize. Euronews correspondent Fred Ponsard says half way through the competition, speculation is rife about the Palme D’or. The latest offerings, “Shield of Straw” by Takeshi Miike and “A Castle in Italy” by Valerie Bruni-Tedeschi have not bowled over the critics and the Chinese film “A Touch Of Sin” is still favourite. Milla Jovovich was among the stars who trod the red carpet for the screening of “A chateau in Italy” by Valerie Bruni-Tedeschi. Her mother, who has a role in the film, was also present. Meanwhile, the festival has screened what could be the first genuinely divisive film in competition. “Shield of Straw” by Japanese director Takashi Miike also received a mixed reception. The high-octane blockbuster depicts a team of security officers attempt to safely move a child murder suspect to Tokyo, in the face of a billion yen reward offered for his head, by the child’s tycoon grandfather.
