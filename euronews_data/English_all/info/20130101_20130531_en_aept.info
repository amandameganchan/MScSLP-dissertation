# ORIG TITLE    North Korea issues new military threats . 
# ORIG CONTENT  North Korea made new threats of military action as the nation celebrated the anniversary of its founder’s birth. Although an expected missile test never materialised on the day normally used to show the reclusive state’s military prowess, the government still issued warnings against South Korea. Despite shows of music and flowers Pyongyang warned of retaliatory action at a moment’s notice. Analysts believe the stand off between North Korea and its neighbours is a bid to force the US to hold talks. Washington has said that can only happen if the North abandons its nuclear weapons ambitions, something its new leader Kim Jong-un has vowed never to give up.
