# ORIG CONTENT  South Koreans show their anger at North Korea’s latest nuclear test which has been denounced by all major powers including Pyongyang’s traditional ally China. A non-binding statement at an emergency session of the UN Security Council condemned the test with US Ambassador Susan Rice pushing for tougher sanctions: . “North Korea does not and will not benefit from violating international law. Far from achieving its stated goal of becoming a strong and prosperous nation, the DPRK has instead increasingly isolated and impoverished its people through its ill-advised pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery.” . North Korea confirmed the test after international monitors recorded seismic activity consistent with a powerful underground explosion on Tuesday morning. Pyongyang residents applauded the test as their government said it would never bow to resolutions on its nuclear programme. With Beijing likely to resist more sanctions which would weaken the north’s economy prompting a flood of refugees, Moscow is calling for more talks.
