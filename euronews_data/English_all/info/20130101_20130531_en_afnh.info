# ORIG CONTENT  The European VEGA rocket launched from the Guiana Space Centre in Kourou early on Tuesday morning to put satellites into orbit. The launcher was originally due to head skywards on Saturday morning, but was delayed because of bad weather. “It’s rather specialised in science, whether it’s the sciences of the earth or the sciences of the universe. This is a launcher that is needed to improve knowledge. It’s also improving competitiveness,” said Jean-Jacques Dordain, Director General of the European Space Agency (ESA). This is the launcher’s second flight, after making its maiden voyage last year. A satellite to map land cover and vegetation changes was due to go into orbit first. That was due to be followed by an Earth observation aircraft for Vietnam and a micro satellite developed by students in Estonia.
