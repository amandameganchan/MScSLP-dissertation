# ORIG TITLE    Dakar Rally: Rain wins stage 11 . 
# ORIG CONTENT  American Kurt Caselli picked up his second stage win of this year’s Dakar Rally when the KTM rider won a rain-hit stage 11 – a 452 km leg of which 190 km were timed – from La Rioja to Fiambalá in Argentina. Caselli crossed the line four minutes and 45 seconds clear of Portuguese Husqvama rider Paulo Goncalves. Defending bike champion Cyril Despres of France was third and extended his lead in the general standings to 13 minutes and 16 seconds over Portugal’s Ruben Faria and just over 18 minutes clear of Chilean Francisco Lopez. The day’s racing in the car category was severely affected by the bad weather which caused flash flooding and made certain sections impossible to drive through. Race officials were forced to stop the stage after just 53 kilometres. American Robby Gordon was first to arrive at that checkpoint to win his 8th career Dakar stage. Stephane Peterhansel – the race’s all-time record holder with ten titles – was sixth and had his overall race lead cut to just under 52 minutes by South African 2009 winner Giniel De Villiers who was fifth on the day.
