# ORIG TITLE    India summons Pakistani envoy as Kashmir tension grows . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Pakistan’s ambassador in New Delhi has been summoned to the Indian foreign office over the killing of two of its soldiers in Kashmir. Indian officials said Pakistani troops crossed into the disputed region and fired on an army patrol. Pakistan’s military has rejected the claims. Indian army officials said one of their soldiers was found ‘badly mutilated’ in a forested area on the side of the demarcation line controlled by India. India’s defence minister A.K.Antony told reporters in New Delhi: “The Pakistan army’s action is highly provocative. The way they treated the dead bodies of the Indian soldiers is inhuman.” . India considers Kashmir its territory, but Pakistan disputes that and wants the population to be allowed to decide. Cross-border exchanges are common along the 740 kilometre frontier despite a ceasefire between the two nuclear-armed nations. India claims eight of its troops were killed last year in scores of incidents. Pakistan claims these latest allegations are to divert attention from the killing of one of its soldiers by Indian forces two days before.
