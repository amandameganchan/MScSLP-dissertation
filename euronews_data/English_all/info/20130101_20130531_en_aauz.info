# ORIG TITLE    Rebensburg reaches world cup double digits . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Viktoria Rebensburg – the 2010 giant slalom Olympic champion – defied the challenging weather conditions to win a world cup Super G race in the Italian resort of Cortina d’Ampezzo. It was her second win in the discipline after the World Cup finals in Schladming last year and tenth career world cup victory. The 26-year-old German beat the driving snow and fog to clock a winning time of one minute and 16.45 seconds. Austrian Nicole Schmidhofer boosted her chances of a national selection for next month’s world championships on home snow in Schladming. Schmidhofer was second for her first career podium finish – 0.33 seconds behind. As Schmidhofer celebrated her first ever podium – Tina Maze celebrated her 15th of the season. The Slovenian was one hundredths of a second behind in third to stretch her overall world cup lead to a now almost uncatchable 718 points with 14 races left on the women’s calendar.
