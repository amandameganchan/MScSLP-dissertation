# ORIG TITLE    Gloves off for Balotelli and Mancini . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Could Manchester City’s controversial striker Mario Balotelli have secured his exit from the English Premier League champions after appearing to be involved in a bust up with coach Roberto Mancini at the club’s training ground? . Pictures were published of the pair at the Carrington training ground in what appeared to be a physical scuffle that required staff and other players to break up. The 22-year-old Italian international has been involved in a series of controversies since his move from Inter Milan in 2010. However Mancini played down the training ground incident on Friday, saying reaction to it had been overblown. “Mario made a tackle on his team mate that I would prefer to see in a game and not against a team mate,” Mancini told reporters. “I asked him to leave the pitch – he said no so I moved him off. “That’s all that happened and it was nothing more than that.” . When asked whether the Italy international still has a future at the club, Mancini said: “Nothing has changed between Mario and me and my thoughts have not changed about him and these things happen from time to time.” . “Will Mario have more chances? I will give him 100 chances as long as I can see him trying to improve and working hard for this football club,” he added.
