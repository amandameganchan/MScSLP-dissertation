# ORIG TITLE    Setback for Obama as assault weapons ban is dropped . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A plan to ban assault weapons is to be dropped from a proposed firearms bill due to lack of support in the US Senate. The measure was to have been one of four backed by President Barack Obama as he seeks to toughen up gun control following a recent school massacre. But the influential lobby group the National Rifle Association has persuaded some lawmakers to oppose the ban which had been put forward by Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid explained the problem for lawmakers: . “Right now her amendment, using the most optimistic numbers, has less than 40 votes. That’s not 60. I have to get something on the floor so we can have votes on that issue and the other issues I’ve talked about.” . Twenty school children and six teachers were murdered last December by a loan gunman with the type of an assault weapon included in the dropped ban.. Obama is still pushing for expanded background checks for potential gun owners and more security for schools.
