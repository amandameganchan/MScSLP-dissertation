# ORIG TITLE    Outbreak of swine flu kills 17 in Venezuela . 
# ORIG CONTENT  In Venezuela 17 people have died and another 250 have been infected from an outbreak of H1N1 flu. The virus, more commonly known as swine flu, swept around the world four years ago. Most of the current cases have been in border states near Colombia. Venezuelaâ€™s health minister has described this latest outbreak as the tail-end of the 2009/2010 pandemic. Officials have also said high-risk groups, mainly the elderly and the very young have already been immunised. Official data released by The World Health Organisation shows that globally 18,500 people were reported killed in the 2009 pandemic but those figures may well be a conservative estimate.
