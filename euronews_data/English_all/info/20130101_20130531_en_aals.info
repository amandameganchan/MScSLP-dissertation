# ORIG TITLE    Vladimir Franz, tattooed musician and wannabe Czech president . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Vladimir Franz is not expected to win the Czech Republicâ€™s first direct election to choose a new president. Round one takes place on Friday and Saturday. Nevertheless, the composer and painter, whose heavily-tattooed body has at least brightened up the campaign, has been doing surprisingly well in the polls. Franz has no political experience but many Czechs are fed up with mainstream politicians. The country is turning the page after two terms under the eurosceptic and controversial Vaclav Klaus. The victor is likely to be pro-European and one of two former prime ministers. Jan Fischer wants to make politicians more accountable. His rival is another ex head of government and former Social Democrat leader, Milos Zeman. Unless one wins an overall majority, a second round will take place in a fortnight. The direct vote by the people follows criticism of alleged back-room deals when the president was chosen by parliament.
