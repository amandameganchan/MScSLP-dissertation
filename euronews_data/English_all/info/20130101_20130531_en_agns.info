# ORIG CONTENT  Former Bosnian Croat leader Jadranko Prlic is one of six to have been sentenced to lengthy prison terms by a UN tribunal in The Hague for war crimes. The court found all six guilty of murder, rape and the expulsion of Muslims in the 1990s Balkans conflict as part of their plan to create an ethnic Croat state during the breakup of Yugoslavia. Outside the court survivors and victims expressed some relief in the sentences for what they had always claimed was a campaign of ethnic cleansing. One camp survivor said that hearing they had been found guilty gave a small amount of satisfaction: . “Finally the people responsible for the atrocities have been named and it has been said publicly who are guilty.” . The six were also held responsible for the destruction of the Ottoman-era Old Bridge at Mostar whose shelling became a symbol of the ravages of the 1992 – 1995 Bosnia war.
