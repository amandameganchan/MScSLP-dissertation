# ORIG CONTENT  Anger against those responsible for a building collapse that killed hundreds in Bangladesh has boiled over into street clashes. Police with tear gas, water canon and rubber bullets were called to Dhaka to stem the violence and put out street fires started by the protesters. At least 350 are confirmed dead while as many as 900 are still missing. On Saturday two factory bosses and two engineers were arrested. Authorities said the eight floor Rana Plaza, on the outskirts of the capital, had been built on spongy ground without the proper permits. The engineers are accused of ignoring warnings after a jolt was felt and cracks appeared on some pillars the previous day. The owner of the building, that had around 3,000 garment workers inside at the time of collapse, is still on the run. An alliance of leftist parties which make up the ruling coalition said it would call a national strike on May 2 if all those responsible had not been arrested. Amazingly, three days after Bangladesh’s worst ever industrial accident people were still being pulled alive from the rubble. One man who was standing close to the rubble holding a picture of a woman told reporters: “She is my wife, we talked over the phone a few moments ago, she is alive, she is lying beside a bathroom there along with three other people, Humayun, Marzina and another girl, they are still alive.” . Bangladesh has a booming 14,5 billion euro garments industry with 60 percent of the clothes going to Europe. British retailer Primark said it was among those that were supplied by factories in the Rana Plaza building.
