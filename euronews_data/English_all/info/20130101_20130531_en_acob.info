# ORIG TITLE    Anger as Italy cuts jail term for Thyssen sentence . 
# ORIG CONTENT  There has been an angry response to an Italian appeals court’s decision to reduce the jail term of a businessman sentenced for manslaughter over a fire that killed seven people. Harald Espenhahn was chief executive of German steelmaker ThyssenKrupp’s Italian arm when the blaze erupted at its plant in Turin in 2007. His sixteen and a half year prison term was cut to ten but relatives of the victims branded the ruling a disgrace. Five other managers also had their sentences reduced after the court ruled the former executive had not been deliberately negligent in cutting back on the emergency services at the factory.
