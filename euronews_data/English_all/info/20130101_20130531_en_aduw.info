# ORIG CONTENT  There was high tension between Palestinian protesters and Israeli troops in the West Bank on the eve of ‘Land Day’. Near the southern West Bank city of Hebron there were clashes between Palestinians and Israeli troops. ‘Land Day’ is when Palestinians mark the day in 1976 when – during protests over Israeli confiscation of Arab land in Galilee – six Arab-Israelis were killed in confrontations and hundreds wounded and arrested. The demonstrators said the initially peaceful march turned to scuffles when Israeli soldiers blocked their access to five villages near Hebron, which are at risk of being cut off from the rest of the West Bank if planned Israeli settlement and wall building goes ahead.
