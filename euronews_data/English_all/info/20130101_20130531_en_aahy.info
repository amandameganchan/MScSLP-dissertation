# ORIG CONTENT  Europe’s top telecoms companies are reportedly discussing the creation of a Europe wide infrastructure network. The Financial Times reported the idea is to unite the region’s disjointed national markets. The newspaper said it was discussed at a private meeting between EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia and bosses of Europe biggest groups, including Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom, Telecom Italia and Spain’s Telefonica. In the past European and national regulators have blocked potential mergers fearing that a few operators would end up dominating the market, but reportedly Almunia believes the infrastructure plan would mean greater efficiency and benefit consumers.
