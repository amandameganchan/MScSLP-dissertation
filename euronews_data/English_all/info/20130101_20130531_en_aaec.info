# ORIG TITLE    Thousands forced out by floods in Rio de Janeiro state . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The neighbourhood of Xerem has been badly affected as more than 3,000 people across Rio de Janeiro state have had to leave their homes due to flooding. Nearly 22 centimetres or rain fell in less than 24 hours in the mountainous region north of Brazil’s Rio de Janeiro city. At least one person has died and eight others are missing. The floods follow two weeks of record high temperatures and the state has been put on high alert. “The girls were sleeping in the living room. We had just enough time to get the children up to the rooftop, because the house flooded very quickly,” said Patrícia Araujo, who lives in one of the affected areas. Hundreds of people have died due to flood-triggered mudslides in and around the state in recent years. Ten days of torrential rain in the same region killed 900 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless in January 2010.
