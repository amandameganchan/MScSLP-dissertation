# ORIG TITLE    Neo-Nazi cell exposed in German prisons . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A covert neo-Nazi network has been uncovered in German prisons. Communicating via coded messages in letters and classified ads, the system was discovered during a cell search in the city of Hesse. The network is said to have attempted to communicate with Beate Zschäpe who stands accused of founding the neo-Nazi NSU which is allegedly implicated in the deaths of eight Turkish men and one Greek. Jörg-Uwe Hahn, Regional Justice Minister of Hesse confirmed that they had “found materials from which we can assume that there was or could be a club structure built up not only throughout the state of Hesse, but nationwide.” They have so far not confirmed whether the network were successful in contacting Zschäpe or members of the NSU. The German authorities say they are tightening prison security checks as they attempt to tackle organised far-right activities with one week to go until Beate Zschäpe faces trial in Munich. The news comes at a sensitive time for Turkish-German relations as the court failed to provide accreditation for many international journalists to cover the trial.
