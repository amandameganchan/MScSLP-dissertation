# ORIG CONTENT  FIFA’s head of security Ralf Mutschke warned Wednesday that the fight against match-fixing cannot be solved without the cooperation of international governments. Speaking at a conference in Kuala Lumpur, the former Interpol director also urged authorities to step up investigations into the scam that involves Singaporean businessman Dan Tan, accused of heading a crime syndicate that made millions by betting on rigged Italian games. According to reports, the Singaporean police is currently awaiting the city state’s authorities to review information before bringing the alleged ‘fixer’ into custody. Mutschke added that FIFA is working to ensure that betting syndicates don’t infiltrate the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, and is providing special training for referees and teams ahead of the tournament.
