# ORIG TITLE    Peking to Paris Vintage Car Challenge roars off in China . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Few car rallies can compete with the stunning backdrop provided by the Great Wall of China. Some 96 vintage and classic cars are setting off from the historic setting in a race to Paris that spans more than 12,000 kilometres. For many, who comes first is not the main priority. For Bentley driver, Daniel Woodcock and his brother, the rally is about honouring the memory of their late father. “My dad decided he was going to do it a couple of years ago, but then he was sadly diagnosed with cancer and passed away last September. So then my brother and I decided that we would do it for him and his memory and carry on his dream and hopefully turn up to Paris. And I’m sure he’ll be looking over us at some point,” said Woodcock. For others, completing the journey will be a victory in itself and a voyage of discovery. Belgian Pierre Malingreau said: “If we can discover this country with an old car, then it’s beautiful. That’s the only reason that we do this rally.” . The participants, who hail from all over the world, will travel through eight countries in 33 days with the rally scheduled to finish in the French capital at the end of next month.
