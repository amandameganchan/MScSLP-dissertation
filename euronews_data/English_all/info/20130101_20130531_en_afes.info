# ORIG TITLE    First stunning images of giant hurricane on Saturn . 
# ORIG CONTENT  NASA’s Cassini spacecraft has captured the first close-up images of a giant hurricane around Saturn’s north pole. The hurricane rotates within a six-sided weather pattern known as the hexagon. At two thousand kilometres across, NASA says the hurricane’s eye is twenty times bigger than the average equivalent on Earth. Scientists think the giant storm has buffeted the solar system’s second largest planet for years. They want to use the data to to study hurricanes on Earth that feed off warm ocean water.
