# ORIG TITLE    Ukraine: so near and yet so far . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Olga will not be able to go and see her husband who lives in France. Both of them are Ukrainian. She used to go and visit him regularly, but since they got married last December she has had more trouble obtaining a visa from French authorities. “It is not that I feel humiliated,” says Olga, “but I feel helpless. I feel that we don’t have the same rights as young people from European countries, and that is the problem.” . The main preoccupation for young Ukrainians who want to see the world is visas. European embassies do not hand them out that easily. Simply submitting a request is a real obstacle course for the inhabitants of Donetsk who live some 700 kilometres from the capital Kiev, home to most of the embassies. Many young Ukrainians dream of emigrating to Europe. In Donetsk, an industrial mining town in eastern Ukraine, the average monthly salary is less than 300 euros. Ukraine is the largest country on the European continent after Russia. It lies at the cross-roads of Europe: to the West, the European Union and the dream of a better life, and to the east, Moscow, and its historic influence over Ukraine. Professor Ihor Todorov, a Europe specialist at Donetsk University, told euronews: “Some young people have really lost hope and all they think about is how to leave the country. But there are others who are hoping to stay and want to work hard to create better standards of life for themselves, to bring European standards of living to Ukraine.” . Kristina is one of those young Ukrainians who dream of a better life in Europe. She works as a tourism officer and believes that, soon, Ukraine will be in her past. “I’m ready to migrate, to live in a country with higher standards,” Kristina tells us. “I hope better times will come to Ukraine because we have so much to offer but I don’t know when this time will come and I have only 60 or 70 years to live, I’m not immortal.” . More than 20 years after independence, surveys show nearly half of Ukrainians want to develop closer ties with Europe, while one third feel closer to their historical ally, Russia. Most do not envisage EU accession for at least another 30 years. “Our economic and political system, our values don’t answer EU requirements,” Kristina tells us. “If you look at countries like Bulgaria or Romania which joined the EU not long ago, you can see that it’s not working for them and I’m afraid my country would run the same risk.” . Kristina also works as a mentor for young foreigners who come to work in Ukraine as part of European exchange programmes. Fabien is one of them. He has settled in well, and has even swapped the traditional French croissant for the traditional borsch soup for breakfast. As part of his European Voluntary Service, Fabien teaches Human Rights and Democracy at a Donetsk high school. International observers from the OSCE denounced last year’s election as a backward step for democracy in Ukraine, marred by “the abuse of power and the excessive role of money”. “These values (human rights, democracy) . already exist here but they’re under-developed,” says Fabien. “The problem is there’s a lack of civic education here. There’s not enough talk of the place of people in society. There’s not much thought, no real debate. When it comes to politics, people are disillusioned, understandably, and they don’t want to get involved.” . Back to Olga, in another classroom. She is taking French lessons at the Alliance Francaise in Donetsk, with the hope of going to university in Toulouse. Whatever it takes, she is determined to find a way of joining her husband in France.
