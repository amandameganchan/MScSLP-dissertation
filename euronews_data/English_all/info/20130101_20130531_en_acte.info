# ORIG TITLE    Grillo feels the heat as political doldrums frustrate Italians . 
# ORIG CONTENT  There was a scrum worthy of any Six Nations rugby match as Italian kingmaker Beppe Grillo was mobbed by the media as the post-election stalemate in Italy continues. Grillo’s contempt for traditional politics has been a theme of his campaign and his vitriol has continued post-election, indicating that the idea of a technocrat government is as dead as a dodo. He even put a picture of a dodo on his website to drive home the message. Grillo’s Five Star Movement, the biggest single party in the country, has balked at the idea of going into coalition with Pier Luigi Bersani’s centre-left group or Silvio Berlusconi’s centre-right bloc. If Bersani’s group fails to cobble together a coalition the task falls to President Giorgio Napolitano to find a way out of the political morass. Consultations begin on March 15.
