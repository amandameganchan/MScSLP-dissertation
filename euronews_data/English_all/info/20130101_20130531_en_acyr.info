# ORIG CONTENT  Former South African President Nelson Mandela has been released from hospital in Pretoria. The 94 year old was admitted for “a pre-existing condition consistent with his age” according to a spokesman for President Jacob Zuma. He added that there was “no need for panic” after concern had grown when the news broke on Saturday. Congregations at church services across the country focused their prayers for the anti-apartheid leader’s quick recovery. His last stay in hospital came in December when he spent nearly three weeks being treated for a lung infection and surgery to remove gallstones. Mandela’s lung problems stem from the 27 years he spent as a political prisoner. Although he is deeply revered by many in South Africa he has played no part in public life for the last decade.
