# ORIG TITLE    The Incredible Burt Wonderstone . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Steve Carrel and Jim Carrey have teamed up for a comedy about illusionists. The glamorous assistant is played by Olivia Wilde. She said: “This film is about maintaining that childlike amazement of things. Kind of understanding why you got into what you love to do, never becoming jaded. I think it really shows the corruption that follows losing your real love for something. I mean that is what it is on deep level. Two super magicians face cut throat competition from guerrilla street magician Steve Gray played by Jim Carrey, whose cult following surges with each outrageous stunt, even their show is starting to look stale. But there’s still a chance Burt and Anton can save the act – both onstage and off – if only Burt can get back in touch with what made him love magic in the first place. US illusionist David Copperfield provided instructions on how the tricks work and was present on set during its filming. The Incredible Burt Wonderstone is out now.
