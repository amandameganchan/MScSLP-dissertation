# ORIG CONTENT  Thomas Cook is to cut 2,500 jobs from its UK workforce and close almost two hundred of its more than one thousand stores there. The economic downturn has meant a slump in sales over the last two years. That led to a string of profit warnings and forced the worldâ€™s oldest travel firm to renegotiate bank loans and dispose of assets to cut its debt. Earlier this week Thomas Cook said it had decided not to sell its under-performing French business and would instead restructure it.
