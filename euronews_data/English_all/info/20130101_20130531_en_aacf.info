# ORIG TITLE    Widow calls for extradition in Chilean murder case . 
# ORIG CONTENT  In Santiago Hugo Sanchez and Jorge Smith have been detained for their alleged role in the 1973 killing of Chilean singer Victor Jara. The former military officers who turned themselves in to the police are among four who are being held. Another ex officer, Pedro Barrientos who lives in the US has denied any involvement. The singer’s widow is demanding his extradition. Jara’s body was exhumed four years ago as part of an investigation into his death. It is understood the singer – who was a member of the Communist party – was tortured days after the coup which brought General Augusto Pinochet to power. “It’s not a time for celebration, it’s a time to be calm and to know that there is a lot of work ahead in order to finally achieve real justice and especially real justice for all the victims,” his widow Joan Jara told supporters . Following the putsch which brought Pinochet to power it is estimated more than 3,000 people were killed. Another 28,000 were tortured during the time the regime ran Chile. Jara wrote protest songs against the ruling elite of his country and was a supporter of President Salvador Allende who was toppled and died in the military uprising. The stadium where many victims were tortured has been renamed the Victor Jara Stadium. Other arrests linked to the case are expected.
