# ORIG CONTENT  A 51-year-old man is in a critical condition after becoming the fourth in Bulgaria to set himself on fire in public in recent weeks. He did so outside the president’s offices as a new interim government was appointed. His reasons are not clear, but at least one protest movement is making a link with anger at poverty and corruption.
