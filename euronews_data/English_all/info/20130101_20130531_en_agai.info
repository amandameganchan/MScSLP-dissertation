# ORIG CONTENT  As well as celebrating extending their shirt sponsorship deal with Emirates by another five years Paris Saint Germain bosses announced they would like to meet another target in the coming weeks. PSG President Nasser Al-Khelaifi said they hoped to persuade former England captain David Beckham to continue to play a role with the French capital club after his retirement from playing at the end of the this season. Al-Khelaifi said: “We (will be) . discussing for the next two weeks. We’re gonna, you know, hopefully announce if we’re gonna reach an agreement together. I hope we will because honestly we want him. I told him, ‘The door is open for you.’ And he wants to be involved, so we’re gonna see how he’s gonna be involved.” . Keeping Beckham on would be another major international business coup for the League One champions following their reported 25-million-euro-a-year kit sponsorship extension. Despite his waning on-pitch talents and now retirement the 38-year-old remains a huge presence in world football and the ideal global brand ambassador.
