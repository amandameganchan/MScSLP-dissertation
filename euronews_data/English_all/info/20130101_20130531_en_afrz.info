# ORIG TITLE    Polls open in Pakistan general election . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Voting is under way in Pakistan’s general election and within hours of polls opening violence was reported in several areas. In Karachi, at least 10 people have been killed and dozens injured after an attack on the offices of an Awami National Party member. There were also bomb attacks in the cities of Peshawar and Quetta. No fatalities have been reported. The country’s border has also been closed with Iran and Afghanistan to avoid any militants entering Pakistan. The election will bring the first transition between civilian governments in a country ruled by the military for half of its history. Disenchantment for the two main parties, the Pakistan Muslim League led by former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and the outgoing Pakistan People’s Party, has given the PTI party of former cricketer Imran Khan a boost in the past week. Over half of the roughly 70000 polling stations across the country have been classified as at risk of attack by mainly the Taliban. Opinion polls have revealed that there could be a record turnout despite the threats of violence.
