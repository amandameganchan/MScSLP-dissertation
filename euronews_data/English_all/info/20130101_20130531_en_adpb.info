# ORIG TITLE    Emergency declared in Kiev cold snap . 
# ORIG CONTENT  While there has been heavy snow in parts of Europe including the UK, in Kiev it has been so bad that a state of emergency has been declared. One month’s normal snow, which is about half-a- metre, has covered the Ukrainian capital in just 24-hours. The army has been brought into action to try and help clear the roads. “Trolleybuses, trams and taxis are stuck, people have to walk, it takes 2-3 hours to get somewhere. The streets are blocked so the snow ploughs can’t get anywhere, the city is paralyzed,” said one brave soul who had ventured outside. Our very cold reporter in Kiev, Angelina Kariakina said the weather forecast is for more snow over the next 2-3 days.
