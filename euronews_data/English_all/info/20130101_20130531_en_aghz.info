# ORIG TITLE    Western Europe wallows in wintry weather . 
# ORIG CONTENT  May continues to bring scant springtime sunshine across western Europe. Instead, unsettled and unusual weather conditions have hit large parts of the continent. Heavy rain and melting snow has caused rivers to overflow and forced hundreds of people out of their homes in eastern Norway. In London, Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Paris temperatures are between five and 10 degrees centigrade lower than expected at this time of year. The snow ploughs are still being used in the Alps. “I have never seen this in my entire life, and even an old man of 90 years old has never seen this. It is very weird,” said one man in Vosges in eastern France as he gestured at the snow. It is not expected to be any higher than 12 degrees anywhere in Switzerland over the weekend – except Ticino in the south, where residents can look forward to what may feel like a scorching 17 compared to the icy conditions in some parts of the country.
