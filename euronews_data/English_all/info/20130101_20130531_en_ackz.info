# ORIG TITLE    Dolce &amp; Gabbana . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The new Dolce and Gabbana winter collection – shown at Milan Fashion Week – referenced Fellini’s 60s movie La Dolce Vita. The clothes were also inspired by Byzantine religious art and classic couture. The Emporio Armani collection was a complete mix of eras and geographies. The silhouette was decidedly feminine, with short organza skirts and lightweight coats. The colour palette was cool shades of green, pink, and purple and his darker colours included royal purple, deep brown and olive green.
