# ORIG CONTENT  Pope Francis wants a poor Church and a Church which serves the poor. He made the statement at an audience of thousands of journalists in the Vatican. Making his mark on the papacy the prudent pontiff explained the reasons behind taking the name Francis after the 12th century saint. “Francis of Assisi is for me the man of poverty, the man of peace. The man who loves and looks after all creation. The poor man… how I would like a poor church and for the poor,” he said. As the Church faces allegations of sexual abuse scandals worldwide and alleged corruption in the Vatican he told journalists that the Church, like any institution had “virtues and sins” and asked them to focus on “truth, goodness and beauty” in their work.
