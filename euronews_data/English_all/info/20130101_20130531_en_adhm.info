# ORIG CONTENT  World Cup champion Gregor Schlierenzauer of Austria claimed his ninth win of the season and 19th of his career on Sunday although he did have to share the top of the podium with Poland’s Piotr Zyla. Schlierenzauer had missed the past three meetings but was back to his best on the large hill in Oslo where he landed jumps of 134.5 metres and 135.0 metres. Schlierenzauer totalled 270.1 points for a share of the victory with Zyla leaving Slovenia’s Robert Kranjec in third place. Schlierenzauer – who is assured his second overall world cup title – will now look to end the season on a winning note with the final stop of the winter next weekend at Planica, Slovenia.
