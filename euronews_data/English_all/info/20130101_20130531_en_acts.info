# ORIG CONTENT  The health of Venezuelan President, Hugo Chavez, has taken a turn for the worse as he is now fighting a new lung infection government officials say. The 58-year-old socialist leader, who made a surprise return from Cuba two weeks ago where he hadd been receiving cancer treatment, has not been seen in public nor heard from in almost three months. “Today his breathing has got worse, which is related to the weakening of his immune system due to his medical state. At present, he has a new and severe infection. His general state continues to be very delicate,” said Ernesto Villegas, Venezuelan Communications Minister. At the weekend hundreds of opposition supporters took to the streets of the Venezuelan capital, Caracus, to demand the government provide full details of the health of the president. Many tied their hands to saying they feel trapped by the Chavez government.
