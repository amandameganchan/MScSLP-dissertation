# ORIG TITLE    US: Amanda Berry’s desperate 911 call . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight were released from a decade of captivity in the US city of Ohio – after Amanda made a desperate bid for freedom. She screamed at the locked door of the house in which they were held – alerting neighbour Charles Ramsey who helped her break down the door. Amanda then called the emergency services on 911. Amanda Berry: “Help me, I’m Amanda Berry.” 911 Operator: “Do you need police, fire or ambulance?” Amanda Berry: “I need police.” 911 Operator: “OK, and what’s going on there?” Amanda Berry: “I’ve been kidnapped and I’ve been missing for 10 years and I’m here, I’m free now.” . - . Amanda was able to make that call after neighbour Charles Ramsey helped her to get out of the house. Ramsey described what happened: “I see this girl going nuts, trying to get out of the house. So I go on the porch, I go on the porch, and she says, ‘Help me get out, I been here a long time’. “So, I figure, you know, it’s a domestic violence dispute. So I opened the door and we can’t get in that way because of how the door is, it’s so much that a body can’t fit through, only our hand. So we kicked the bottom and she comes out with the little girl and she says, ‘Call 911’,” Ramsey continued.
