# ORIG TITLE    Fenninger wins Garmisch super-G . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Former world combined champion Anna Fenninger stunned the big guns on Sunday to win her very first World Cup super-G race at the German resort of Garmisch-Partenkirchen. The 23-year-old from Salzburg had only won twice before on the elite circuit – both giant slaloms and one of which came this season on home snow in December in Semmering. On Sunday Fenninger tamed the one and a half mile Kandahar course to clock a winning time of one minute, 20.43 seconds for her first victory in a speed event. Fenninger, who won giant slalom bronze at the world championships in Schladming last month, held off the stiff challenge of hometown favorite Maria Hoefl-Riesch for the win. Hoefl-Riesch missed out on her 25th world cup triumph by two tenths of a second. It was the 28-year-old’s second podium finish in three races at her home resort after she finished a solid third in Saturday’s Downhill . Nevada native Julia Mancuso rounded off the podium in third place to continue the US female team’s fine showing in the speed events this year. Last season’s overall Super-G runner up was 0.23 seconds off the pace. Runaway overall World Cup leader Tina Maze – who broke the record number of world cup points for a season after her downhill win the day before – was fourth despite suffering the distraction of being placed under the protection of bodyguards after receiving death threats.
