# ORIG TITLE    School drop-outs: dealing with failure . 
# ORIG CONTENT  School drop-out rates have reached up to 60 percent in some countries according to the OECD. Why students fail in school is a vital question but it is equally important to examine the best ways to re-engage students in their education. Learning World meets Jennifer, a former school drop-out whose future is bright after she got training through the job agency. Work and real life experience is one thing, but how about reforming the system from the inside and rethinking the whole approach towards failing students? How about highlighting their strengths instead of their weaknesses? To find out more, Learning World spoke to education expert Joel Bonamy in France. Also in this edition of the programme, we travel to South Africa. According to recent reports at Davos, South Africa ranks at 133 out of 142 countries in terms of overall quality of education. This means many students could be dropping out as a result of poor educational services. But it is not all gloom and doom. American film-maker Molly Blank has documented some schools which are fighting back. We visit a successful high school in the township of Masiphumelele.
