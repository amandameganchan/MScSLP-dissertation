# ORIG CONTENT  Tearful parents were reunited with their bewildered children after their quiet Oklahoma neighbourhood was flattened by Monday’s tornado. Such was the force of the storm that the Plaza Towers primary school resembles nothing more than a pile of matchsticks. At least seven children are known to have lost their lives when the building crumbled. Amy Sharp had only ten minutes to get to the school and pick her daughters up – a dash that saved their lives. “Something just told me that my kids would be safer with me than in the school. And apparently my kids were safer with me than they were in the school, because my kids would have been in Plaza Towers Elementary, which is no longer there. And I’m about to cry, I’m sorry” . “It’s like half of the ceiling’s like on the ground and there’s wires hanging out from the walls and there’s glass everywhere. And like if you look outside, the building looked like it just collapsed.’‘, Jenna added. Experts say the Moore tornado was a top-of-the-scale EF-5 twister with winds of at least 200 mph (322 kph).
