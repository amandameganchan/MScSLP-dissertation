# ORIG TITLE    Malaysia: Coalition retains power with election win . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Malaysia’s governing coalition has extended its half-century rule, despite its worst ever performance in a general election. It was the 13th consecutive victory for prime minister Najib Razak’s National Front coalition since independence from Britain in 1957. It faced the strongest ever challenge at the ballot box. The opposition hoped to capitalise on allegations of arrogance, abuse of public funds and racial discrimination, which are being made against the government. Anwar Ibrahim and other opposition leaders are signaling that they may dispute the election results, amid suspicions of fraud. Although it has held onto power, the National Front emerges from this poll on a much weaker footing.
