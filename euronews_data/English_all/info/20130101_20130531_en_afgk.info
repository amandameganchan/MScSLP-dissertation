# ORIG CONTENT  The leader of the Lebanese-based militant group, Hezbollah has warned Syrian rebels fighting the troops of President Bashar al-Assad they will never be able to topple him by force. Hassan Nasrallah also indicated that his fighters have been assisting Syrian government forces by admitting some of his men had been killed in Syria. In a televised speech from an undisclosed location, Nasrallah, who is a staunch ally of President Assad, expressed his support: “Syria,” he said, “has real friends in the region and the world who will not allow Syria to fall into the hands of America or Israel or infidels. They will not allow that.” . Syrian rebels who are mainly Sunni Muslims have for some months accused the powerful Shi’ite group of intervening in the conflict against Assad. Until now Hezbollah had formally denied getting involved claiming only to be protecting Shi’ite villages along the border with Lebanon.
