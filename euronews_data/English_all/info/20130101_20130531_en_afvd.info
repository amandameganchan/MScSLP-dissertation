# ORIG TITLE    Mancini tripped up by European failures and tactical errors . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The end of Mancini mood music at Manchester City was sudden and unexpected, at least for the manager, and on the heels of a mind-numbing FA Cup final loss the sacking capped the former champion’s miserable year. In three and half years the Italian brought three trophies to a City where there had been none for 35 years. The fans loved him; some of his players, managers and officials less so and this year some say his tactics have fallen short of what’s expected, especially in the champion’s league where he has a poor record. City’s Abu Dhabi owners crave European success, and it appears, now they have tasted it in England, that they are impatient to take the club to another level. Over 400 million euros was spent on players during Mancini’s era, and there is likely to be a huge shakeup at the club on and off the pitch whenever a new man is appointed, but he appears sure to have plenty of money at his disposal to make changes.
