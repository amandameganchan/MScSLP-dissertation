# ORIG TITLE    Jobs carnage continues in Greece . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Greece’s unemployment rate climbed to a new record of 28.6 percent of the workforce in October. The number of people who are out of work has almost tripled in the past three years as austerity measures have battered its economy. After six years of recession, the jobless total in the debt-laden country is more than double the eurozone’s average. Unemployment among young Greeks – those under 24 – reached a new record of 56.6 percent. A record 1.34 million Greeks were without work in October, up 38 percent from the same month in 2011, the government statistics service ELSTAT said, with another 36,219 lost after September when the jobless rate stood at 26.2 percent.
