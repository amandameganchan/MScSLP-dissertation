# ORIG CONTENT  The US has dismissed a speech made by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad as ‘a meaningless attempt to retain power’ and called on him to step down. In general, Western countries and Syria’s opposition agreed that the address – Assad’s first since June – offered nothing new. Damascus had billed the speech as unveiling a new peace plan but the Syrian leader offered no concessions. Turkey’s Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said empty commitments would not allow progress: . “If it is clear now that Assad will not do anything new, then the UN Security Council must decide on a stance on the situation in Syria. The first decision needs to be made on distributing aid to the Syrian people.” . Refugees who have fled the violence at home had been hoping for movement on the UN-Arab League initiative towards a political settlement. But instead Assad hardened his position calling his supporters to ‘a war to defend the nation’.
