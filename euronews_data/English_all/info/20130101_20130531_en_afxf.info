# ORIG CONTENT  Authorities have raided offices of Shell, BP and Statoil as part of a probe into suspected manipulation of oil prices. The European Commission says it is investigating major oil companies over possible anti-competitive agreements â€“ related to the submission of prices to leading oil pricing agency Platts. It added that inspections took place in two EU member states and one non-EU country. The Commission also said that companies may have prevented others from participating in the price assessment process, with a view to distorting published prices.
