# ORIG TITLE    Pistorius to enter plea today . 
# ORIG CONTENT  South African athelete Oscar Pistorius is expected to make the first defence of his actions at todayâ€™s bail hearing at a court in Johannesbourg. It is his second bail appearance before a judge since being arrested following a shooting at his home during which his girlfriend, model Reeva Steenkamp, was killed. Police have charged him with her murder. The first hearing ended when he broke down in tears. Intially it was reported Pistorius had mistaken Steenkamp for an intruder, but police now insist she was killed by more than one gunshot, and that neighbours had reported hearing earlier disturbances at the house. They found no evidence of a break-in. The South African press has been full of speculation, lurid details and alleged leaks from the investigators, and on Monday the Steenkamp family spoke for the first time of their desire to get at the truth, and their grief. Their daughter is cremated today.
