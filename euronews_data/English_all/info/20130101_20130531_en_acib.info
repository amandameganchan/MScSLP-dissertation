# ORIG CONTENT  India’s main cities have been placed on high alert after a series of bomb blasts killed at least 14 people in a crowded market-place in Hyderabad. As many as 119 others were injured in the attack. Explosives had been strapped to at least two bicycles which were detonated in quick succession. India’s political leaders are urging a united front against terrorism. “This time, every political party should come together to make sure terrorism is stopped. People must not fall out….this time, we can criticise each other later; now is not the right time,” said V. Hanumantha Rao, leader of India’s ruling Congress Party. It is not known who was responsible for the blasts but two weeks ago India hanged a Kashmiri man for an attack on the country’s parliament. Opposition leader Rajnath Singh said: “I believe that through this incident, militants are trying to challenge India. A comprehensive investigation should be done of the entire incident” . The southern city of Hyderabad is a hub of India’s computing industry. Two years ago three blasts which ripped through India’s financial capital, Mumbai were set off by Muslim militants.
