# ORIG TITLE    UK: Police say no chemicals found at Berezovsky home . 
# ORIG CONTENT  British police investigating the death of Russian tycoon Boris Berezovsky say there are no suspicious circumstances, but they are keeping an open mind. Detectives have found no evidence of chemical, biological or nuclear material at his home near London. It has led some to speculate that he may have taken his own life, after losing a series of costly legal battles. James Nixey from The Royal Institute of International Affairs said: “Clearly, this man who was once pretty much the richest man in Russia in the 1990s, had lost much of his fortune. He was obviously still living in a mansion in Surrey in the United Kingdom, so it’s not clear to a certain extent. “So, we don’t really know much about his state of mind, other than hearsay and speculation. But clearly, his fortunes had faded, politically and financially, in the last ten to two years, respectively.” . It has also emerged an employee found the 67-year-old’s body in a bathroom that had been locked from the inside.
