# ORIG TITLE    Chinese PM Li Keqiang in India to boost trade and ease tension . 
# ORIG CONTENT  China’s new prime minister is making his first trip abroad since taking office in March, arriving first in India. Beijing says Li Keqiang’s visit to Delhi shows the importance China attaches to improving relations between the two countries – the most populous in the world. It comes weeks after a stand-off between Indian and Chinese troops along the disputed border in eastern Kashmir, an episode which revived long-standing tensions. In the end a deal was reached and both sides pulled back. But right-wing Hindu activists wanted a tougher reaction from their own government to China’s alleged incursion. They demonstrated near India’s parliament, calling on the Chinese leader to go home. It is unlikely to disturb both governments who have already agreed to boost trade by 50 percent to nearly 80 billion euros over the next three years. After three days in India Li’s next stop will be to Pakistan, before he heads to Switzerland and Germany.
