# ORIG TITLE    Spielberg to head Cannes Jury . 
# ORIG CONTENT  E.T. goes home. Steven Spielberg has been picked to head this year’s Cannes Film Festival jury. The US director’s film E.T. had its world premiere at the French festival in 1982, and he has been a regular in Cannes ever since. His first star turn in Cannes came in 1974 when he won best screenplay for Sugarland Express. The Festival’s director had been trying to get Spielberg on the jury for years, but his film commitments always clashed. He will be taking over from Italian director Nanni Moretti. Credited with creating the summer blockbuster, Spielberg will be bringing a touch of Hollywood glamour to the Cote d’Azur when the festival begins in May, with a pedigree of Oscar-winning films. Though his latest film Lincoln was nominated for Oscars in 12 categories he failed to scoop a statuette for best director. However, it did secure best actor Daniel Day-Lewis a place in Oscar history with his third win.
