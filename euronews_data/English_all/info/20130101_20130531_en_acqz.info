# ORIG TITLE    Protests and parades on Bulgaria’s Liberation Day . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Bulgarians across the country staged new protests against their political leaders and poverty on the day celebrated as Liberation Day. March 3 marks the 135th anniversary of Bulgaria’s freedom from the Ottoman Empire. Organisers of Sunday’s protests called for calm as marchers mixed alongside the more traditional parades. In the last two weeks, demonstrations which began against rocketing utility bills and low living standards turned into condemnation of the political system matched by civil unrest. Bulgaria faces early elections in May in which protest votes could leave the main parties struggling to form a majority.
