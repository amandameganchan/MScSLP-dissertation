# ORIG TITLE    Berlusconi shakes up Italian election at Rome rally . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Creeping back up the polls, the three times Italian Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi shows he still has what it takes to shake up an election. With just three weeks to go, his party is now polling at 28%, the opposition left-wing party at 34%. Berlusconi rallied his supporters in Rome, where he continued to take aim at Europe. “We must work to make Europe change its suicidal austerity policy,” he said. Berlusconi’s controversial pledge to repeal the unpopular property tax on first homes has been labelled “dangerous electoral propaganda” by the left-wing opposition. The man who succeeded Berlusconi when he stepped down in 2011, technocrat Mario Monti is lagging behind in the polls. He is seen as too close to Brussels. Commentators say this could just cost him the election.
