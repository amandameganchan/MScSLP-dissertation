# ORIG TITLE    No role for Assad post-conflict – Friends of Syria . 
# ORIG CONTENT  President Bashar al-Assad will have no role to play in a peaceful Syria. That is according to the participants of a meeting Jordan of the Friends of Syria, a group of Western nations trying to broker a peace deal proposed by the US and Russia. It builds on last year’s stalled plan for a peaceful transition of power. “In the event that the Assad regime is unwilling to negotiate Geneva 1 in good faith, we will also talk about our continued support and growing support for the opposition in order to permit them to continue to be able to fight for the freedom for their country” US Secretary of State John Kerry told the delegates. Pro-Assad supporters outside carried banners asking if these are the Friends of Syria, then who are the enemies? . The group also urged Hezbollah to withdraw its fighters from the conflict and warned of “grave consequences” if the use of chemical weapons is confirmed.
