# ORIG TITLE    Egypt’s Mubarak cleared of murder to remain behind bars . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Egypt’s Appeal Court has acquitted former President Hosni Mubarak of murder over the death of more than 800 demonstrators during the 2011 uprising. It comes after the 84-year-old appeared in public on Saturday for the first time since his last June. His retrial was dramatically abandoned when the presiding judge withdrew from the case citing his “unease” in reviewing the case. Mubarak must remain in jail however as he still faces corruption charges.
