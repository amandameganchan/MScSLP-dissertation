# ORIG TITLE    Air raid in Damascus kills dozens, claim activists . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A petrol station has been attacked on the eastern edge of Damascus. A video taken by activsts which could not be independently verified shows the carnage. Witnesses claim at least 30 were killed in an attack by warplanes at lunchtime. Reports suggest the attack happened after a consignment of fuel had just arrived and crowds packed the forecourt for a rare chance to fill their vehicles’ tanks. Muleiha, where this happened, is a residential and industrial area in the eastern Ghouta region of Damascus that also houses a Syrian air defence base. In a separate shelling the road linking Damascus to the airport came under attack. Government forces control the centre of the capital and have been pounding the suburbs from the air. Rebel forces see the threat from the air as President Asaad’s main weapon. In a strategic attack the Syrian Observatory for Human rights said rebels struck a military air base near the main Aleppo-Damascus highway. The al Qaeda-linked al-Nusra front fired machine guns and mortars at helicopters on the ground at the Taftanaz military airport. State media have not commented on the fighting.
