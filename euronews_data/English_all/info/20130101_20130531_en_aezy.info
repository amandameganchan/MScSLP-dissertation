# ORIG TITLE    China orders 60 Airbus planes . 
# ORIG CONTENT  French President Francois Hollande’s two-day visit to Beijing focusing on trade has included China signing a deal with European planemaker Airbus to purchase 60 jets. The deal partially lifts what Airbus has described as a Chinese boycott on the purchase of its long haul A330 planes, that followed a row with the European Union over curbing airline emissions. A large group of French business leaders accompanied Hollande, who is the first leader of a major western country to visit China since the change of leadership there. Airbus said the order comprised 18 wide-bodied A330s and 42 smaller A320-family jets. Some European industry officials had hoped for an order of 100 aircraft or more to feed China’s rapid aviation growth. Carbon emissions row . According to the planemaker, China last year blocked orders for up to 45 A330 planes in protest at EU measures to make foreign airlines pay for carbon emissions. A group of nations, led by China, argues that the EU’s emissions trading scheme infringes their sovereignty, since it bases the charges on whole trips, including the parts in non-EU airspace. The EU says such measures are necessary under the bloc’s obligations to tackle pollution. In November, the EU’s executive Commission agreed to suspend the scheme for foreign airlines for a year, pending international negotiations and amid warnings of retaliation. The suspension was officially published just before the Airbus signing ceremony in China.
