# ORIG TITLE    Stars line red carpet for Oscars . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Sunday night is Oscars night. We selected a special list of the nominees for best actress and best actor of the 85th Annual Academy Award. Jessica Chastain is up for her role as a dogged CIA agent leading the manhunt for Osama Bin Laden. The youngest nominee is nine-year old Quvenzhané Wallis. She plays “Hushpuppy”, a young girl with a lively imagination who helps residents of her Louisiana swampland cope with an impending flood. At the age of 85, Emmanuelle Riva is the oldest nominee for her part as an elderly woman in her agonizing final months as her husband tries to cope with her terminal illness. And Naomi Watts was nominated for her star turn in “The Impossible”. The 44-year old plays an English mother of three whose family miraculously survives the 2004 tsunami in Thailand. The film is based on real life events. The two leading characters of “Silver Linings Playbook” Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper were also in the running for the award. But this years front-runner is Daniel Day-Lewis for his appearance as the 16th U.S. President in “Lincoln”. A win would make him the first person to win best actor three times. Hugh Jackman secures his first Oscar nod for his role as Jean Valjean, a 19th century prisoner who changes his identity in “Les Miserables”. But this is the third nomination for Joaquin Phoenix for his role in “The Master”. He plays an alcoholic World War II veteran who turns to the founder of a controversial group known as The Cause for help. And Denzel Washington could bag a prize too for his part as a pilot with a substance abuse problem who turns over a new leaf after he performs a daring manoeuvre during an airplane crash.
