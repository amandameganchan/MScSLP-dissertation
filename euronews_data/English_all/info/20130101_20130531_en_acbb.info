# ORIG TITLE    Blasts across Baghdad in Shi’ite muslim areas . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Dozens of people have been killed in a series of bombings in Baghdad. Iraqi police say 28 people are dead and 800 were wounded in attacks in mainly Shi’ite areas of the capital. Cars packed with explosives blew up in busy areas – including a market, shops and restaurants in the Habibiya district and the Sadr City slum in northern Baghdad. Sectarian violence in Iraq is not as bad as the peak period of 2006-2007. However, there are still sporadic attacks on Shi’ite Muslims in an effort to erode confidence in the government. Since the fall of former leader Saddam Hussein, Iraq’s Shi’ite majority have gained more political power. A suicide bomber killed the head of the army’s intelligence school Brigadier General Aouni Ali and two of his bodyguards on February, 16. No one has claimed responsibility for the attacks.
