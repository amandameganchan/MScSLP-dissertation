# ORIG TITLE    Dakar rally: Despres wins stage nine . 
# ORIG CONTENT  France’s Cyril Despres produced a stunning performance to claim the ninth stage of the Dakar Rally from San Miguel de Tucuman to Cordoba in Argentina on Tuesday. The defending champion, bidding for a fifth Dakar title, completed the 852km trek in an impressive time of 5 hours and 41 minutes to edge out Joan Barreda. This win, combined with the misfortune of Yamaha rider David Casteu sees Despres move into second place in the overall standings. And in the car category, Spain’s Nani Roma kept his composure to claim his second stage win this year. The 40 year old and his co-driver Michel Perin finished just four minutes ahead of current leader Stephen Peterhansel while Argentina’s Orlando Terranova eventually had to settle for third place.
