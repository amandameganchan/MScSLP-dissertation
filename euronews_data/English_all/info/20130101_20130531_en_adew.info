# ORIG TITLE    Chavez to go on display at Venezuelan Revolution Museum . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The body of Hugo Chavez is to be moved from a military academy in Caracas to Venezuela’s Revolution Museum. Millions of people have already filed past the late Venezuelan leader who died last week after a two year long fight against cancer. It remains unclear, however, whether his body will be embalmed as the government says the process should have started earlier. Chavez’s death has brought an outpouring of emotion in Venezuela, especially among his millions of mostly poor supporters, many of whom viewed him almost as a religious figure even before his death. Critics, however, have accused the government of manipulating people’s emotions to help acting President Nicolas Maduro win an election next month.
