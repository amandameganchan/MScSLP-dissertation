# ORIG CONTENT  Protests have resumed across Egypt in what’s been described as a “Friday of dignity”. Several groups marched on Cairo’s Tahrir Square, demanding a new unity government to temper the dominance of the Muslim Brotherhood. Other protesters have hit out at a decision by radical Muslim clerics to issue fatwas – sanctioning the assassination of key opposition figures. Among them is Mohamed ElBaradei, the former chief of UN nuclear watchdog. Opponents of Egyptian President Mohammed Mursi want amendments to the new Constitution and guarantees that the independence of the judiciary will be respected.
