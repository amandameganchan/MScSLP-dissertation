# ORIG TITLE    Dortmund back among Europe’s elite . 
# ORIG CONTENT  There were wild celebrations in Dortmund on Tuesday night after the city’s football team held off a remarkable comeback by Real Madrid to book their place in the final of the Champions League. Despite winning the second leg 2-0 Real Madrid fell just short of a place in final at Wembley (losing 4-3 on aggregate) and after the game coach Jose Mourinho couldn’t help but lash out at English referee Howard Webb for missing a second half handball by the German’s. The self-proclaimed Special One said: “It’s not a penalty, it is foul because it was out of the box, but it is clearly a red card because Cristiano’s (Ronaldo) pass leaves (Karim) Benzema in front of the goalkeeper. Mats Hummels stops the ball: red card, with 18 minutes remaining plus the injury time, around 23, 24 minutes to the end. During this time Webb was not a referee, he was a human being and thought ‘this kid (Hummels) is not going to play the final (if I send him off)’.” . Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp meanwhile was already looking forward to the May 25th final in London. “It will be one of the greatest moments (to play the final in Wembley) in our life. But I can say, when we are there, we don’t want to be a tourist. I think it’s not important against which team we play, we are not the favourites, so it’s the perfect role,’‘ said Klopp. Whether they meet Bayern Munich or Barcelona it’s safe to say Dortmund have made their way back into Europe’s elite and come May 25th the Germans will hunt their second European title after lifting the trophy in 1997 on their only other appearance in the competition’s showpiece match.
