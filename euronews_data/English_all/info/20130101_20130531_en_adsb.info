# ORIG TITLE    Italian pop star brands MPs as ‘whores’ . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Italian pop star Franco Battiato may not be the superstar that he is inside his homeland. But he went some way to raising his profile on the European stage yesterday. Battiato shocked MEPs in Brussels when he branded Italian lawmakers as “whores”. The 68-year-old’s tirade landed him in hot water. He’s been sacked as the Regional Councillor for Culture in Sicily, where he worked with Beppe Grillo’s Five Star Movement. But the songwriter is unrepentant. “After 20 years, it’s a dissaster, it’s terrible. It’s so painful to see that, while people steal money without any shame, other people don’t even have money to eat. 5-6 million people live in poverty, it’s unacceptable,” he said. Battiato is best known at home for his anti-mafia, anti-corruption song, Povera Patria. He wants Grillo to backtrack on his election vow not to negotiate with the mainstream political parties. He told euronews that forming a government is more important. “I would ask him to make a decision. We (the country) can’t go on like this much longer, we risk too much. Grillo needs to decide, also closing one eye (even if it’s not the best option for him).” .
