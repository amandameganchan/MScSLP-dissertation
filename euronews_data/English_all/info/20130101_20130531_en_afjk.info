# ORIG TITLE    West Bank Barrier creates hardship for Palestinian villagers . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Israel argues that the West Bank Barrier is necessary for its security, while critics say the wall’s construction is an attempt to annex Palestinian land illegally. Euronews visited Azzun, a Palestinian village divided. One resident said the barrier had been built straight through his fields: “Today we can’t do our work like before. Sometimes Israeli soldiers come to our fields and chase us. Sometimes they come to our house while we are working the roof.” . Speaking from near her home, a Palestinian woman explained how her life has changed: “My field is a few metres from here, but they don’t allow me to enter to bring water, we have to call first for permission. The situation was normal before, we could bring the water when we wanted, but now we’re restricted.” . Euronews correspondent Mohammed Shaikhibrahim reported from Azzun: “Although the International Court has confirmed both the illegitimacy of the wall and the need to remove it, Israel has continued to build it. “But Palestinians living here say it’s swallowed up large tracts of their land, making it difficult to go about their daily lives.” .
