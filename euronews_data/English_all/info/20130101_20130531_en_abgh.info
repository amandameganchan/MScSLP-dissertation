# ORIG CONTENT  Many of the 11 million illegal immigrants living in the US are hoping the president’s speech on immigration reform will give them a better chance of citizenship. Obama has his own blueprint for immigration reform, but he is expected to back another slightly different one put together by a bipartisan group of senators, which is to be “largely consistent” with the president’s plan. Speaking from a Las Vegas high school on Tuesday around 11.15 local time, Obama will talk about an issue that led to one of the biggest re-election promises. “It’s an opportunity for all of us, I really hope the president keeps his promise and lays out a plan,” said one man close to the San Ysidro port of entry in San Diego, California. “It’s great if we all can be here, but laws on this side of the border have to be respected,” said a woman on the US side of the Mexican border bridge near San Ysidro. Officials say Obama will not be revealing any legislation of his own, but is instead hoping to rally support for plan put together by the cross-party group of senators. A number of efforts to overhaul immigration over the past two decades have failed – hampered by right-wing Republicans. The new proposal also includes enhanced security to prevent illegal immigration in the future.
