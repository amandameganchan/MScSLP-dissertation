# ORIG CONTENT  Japanâ€™s leading electronics firm Sony has returned to profit for the first time in five years. Turning the 3.52 billion euro loss of 2011 into the 331 million euro profit last year was partly due asset sales and a weaker yen, which has fallen 20% against the dollar since November. It is forecasting a 385 million profit for 2013.
