# ORIG TITLE    Fake mugshots put Greek police in hot water . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Police in Greece are under investigation after it was alleged they beat a group of four suspected bank robbers, then altered their photos to minimise their injuries. Police say the alterations were needed to make the men recognisable to the public to allow more information to be gathered. The Greek police force has in the past been criticised by human rights activists for what they claim are its brutal methods. The police claimed the men were “heavily armed terrorists”, with a least two said to have links to an extremist group suspected of planting bombs. The four men, all in their twenties, were arrested in the northern town of Kozani. Greece’s Public Order minister said any officer found guilty of abuse will be punished.
