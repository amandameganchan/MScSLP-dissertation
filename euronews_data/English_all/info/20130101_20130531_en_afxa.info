# ORIG CONTENT  US drone technology has taken a big step forward with the first-ever launch from an aircraft carrier. The X-47B also has a range of almost double the drones currently being used. “This will be the future of warfare and it will be a warfare that is a little less risky for humans but maybe a little more effective when it comes to delivering weapons and effect,” said James Lewis from the Centre for Strategic and International Studies.
