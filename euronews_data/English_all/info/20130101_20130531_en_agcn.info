# ORIG CONTENT  Police in Israel are investigating a shootout at a bank in the southern city of Be’er Sheva in which a man killed four people before turning his gun on himself. The assailant is said to have been local, Jewish and in his 40s. But what was at first thought to have been a bungled attempted robbery, police now think may have been a dispute over the refusal of a loan. The incident drew comment from the Israeli prime minister: . “This is very serious. I do not remember such an event, certainly not in the last few years and it is not common place in Israel. An attack like this must not be allowed to happen again,” said Prime MInister Benjamin Netanyahu. Police are looking into whether the gunman had financial difficulties or if he had any other personal dispute with one of the bank workers. All four victims, they said, were killed by the attacker and did not die in the shootout with security officials.
