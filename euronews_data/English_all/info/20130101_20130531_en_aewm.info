# ORIG TITLE    Götze agrees to join Bayern Munich . 
# ORIG CONTENT  German international Mario Götze has agreed to sign for Bayern Munich after the Bavarians triggered the €37 million release clause in his Borussia Dortmund contract. The 20-year-old becomes the most expensive German player of all time, with this transfer eclipsing the previous Bundesliga record of €30 million that Bayern reportedly paid Stuttgart for Mario Gomez in 2009. Götze, who made his Bundesliga debut aged 17 in November 2009, will arrive at Bayern at the same time as former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola. Bayern secured the league crown on 6 April with six games to spare – a Bundesliga record. They are currently 20 points ahead of second-placed Dortmund.
