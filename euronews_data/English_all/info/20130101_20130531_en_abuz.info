# ORIG CONTENT  Designer Betsey Johnson upped her game at New York Fashion Week with a sexy sports range called BJ kicks A. The 70-year-old New Yorker practices yoga, studied dance as a child and loves the whole workout look. She used a rainbow of colours for her collection of jackets, trousers, shorts and leggings. And to put her clothes to the test she led her models in a workout on the runway.
