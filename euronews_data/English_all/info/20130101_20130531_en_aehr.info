# ORIG CONTENT  As Venezuela’s election approaches tensions on the streets of Caracas have erupted into violence as “Chavista” youths fought with opposition student protesters. Police fired shots in the air to disperse the combatants and seven students were injured. Acting President and candidate Nicolas Maduro wants an end to the violence: . “I have ordered security forces to view CCTV footage and investigate what happened. I am determined to guarantee the security of the country,” he said. Polls show Maduro is well ahead of his election rival Henrique Capriles. Capriles, a 40-year-old state governor, held a major rally on Sunday and tens of thousands turned up to hear him speak. Still the man who wants to install a Brazilian-style free market economy trails in the wake of the goodwill generated by the social spending policies of the late leader Hugo Chavez. The country votes on April 14.
