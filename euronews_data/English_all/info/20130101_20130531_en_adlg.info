# ORIG TITLE    Bowie expo sells out at V&amp;A . 
# ORIG CONTENT  TIckets to the David Bowie exhibition at the V&amp;A in London are selling like hot cakes. There are around 300 items on display, tracing Bowie’s career as a writer, musician, designer, singer and performer. Co-curator Victoria Broackes said: “His individualism seems to have inspired a generation to feel that that we all have it within ourselves. We have multiple personas, that we should not be pigeon-holed by sexuality or identity or dress, And I think that is perhaps his great message. Although of course, he is not political, so he doesn’t put it like that.” . The exhibition coincides with the release of Bowie’s new album “The Next Day”, his first new record for a decade, and includes iconic items such as his Aladdin Sane bodysuit and his Pierrot costume from Ashes to Ashes. The exhibition runs until mid-August.
