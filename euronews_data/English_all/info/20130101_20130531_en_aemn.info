# ORIG TITLE    Lucky escape for Lion Air passengers in Bali . 
# ORIG CONTENT  All 108 passengers and crew survived a frightening crash in Bali after a Lion Air Boeing 737 missed the runway and ditched in shallow water. At least 16 people were taken to hospital for injuries and shock but there were no reports about any being in a serious condition. Lion Air is Indonesiaâ€™s largest budget airline, which last month signed a contract for 234 Airbus planes worth over 18 billion euros. However along with several other Indonesian carriers it was banned from European skies in 2007 because of its poor safety record, a ban that was progressively lifted two years later. The Airbus contract was the second record order for Lion in two years. In 2011 it agreed to buy 230 planes from Boeing.
