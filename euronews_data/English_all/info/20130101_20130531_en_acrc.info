# ORIG CONTENT  Ethic minorities, Nobel prize winners and show biz types were among the delegates at a meeting of China’s People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) on March 3. The CPPCC, which is made up of around 2,000 delegates, has a largely ceremonial role in advising the National People’s Congress (NPC). It attracts a lot of attention from the Chinese public because of the mix of people involved – many of whom are not members of the ruling Communist party. Film director Chen Kaige spoke out on pollution on his way into the meeting. “We have said clearly that air pollution is a problem that derives from the speed of economic development. We cannot forget this because it affects everyone.” . The NPC meets on March 5, when China’s new government will formally take over – with Communist Party chief Xi Jinping succeeding Hu Jintao as the country’s president.
