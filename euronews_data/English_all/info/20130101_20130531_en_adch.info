# ORIG TITLE    Vatican: no white smoke, no decision . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The Roman Catholic faithful watch and wait for a plume of white smoke from the Vatican, signalling that a new pope has been chosen. Behind the closed doors of the Sistine Chapel,115 Cardinals are deliberating for a second day over who will succeed Benedict XVI – who stepped down on February 28. Local man Saverio told euronews he thinks that the new pope will be foreign, adding “I hope for an innovative one, but one who’s linked to the Roman Curia. The Church has its own traditions and rules and they need to be respected.” . Richi, from Japan said: “As a Japanese I don’t have any idea, but as a person living in Italy, they say that it should be an American, or a Canadian or an Italian, I’ve heard. Religion is not a thing of globalisation. It’s a personal thing.” . Euronews correspondent Alberto de Filipis reported from Rome: “It’s day two and the atmosphere among tourists and passers by is more tense than yesterday. The black smoke lets us all know that the wait continues to know the name of the next pope.” .
