# ORIG TITLE    Italian cabinet comes together . 
# ORIG CONTENT  After two months of political wrangling, newly-appointed Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta has formed a new cabinet. He brings together his own Democratic Party members and opposition members from former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi’s centre-right People of Freedom Party. Letta was in upbeat mood about the team. Speaking at a press conference, he said: . “It’s a team of ministers that is very competent, that is young, and also includes a record number of women, for me that is one of the greatest satisfactions.” . Letta was charged with bringing together a cohesive government by President Giorgio Napolitano, who himself was only inaugurated about a week ago. In a sign that Letta is willing to build on his reputation as a bridge-builder, Angelino Alfano from People of Freedom party was appointed Deputy Prime Minister. Fabrizio Saccomanni, the Italian Central Bank’s experienced director-general will head up the powerful Economy Ministry. And the post of Justice Minister went to Anna Maria Cancellieri, a member of the outgoing Prime Minister Mario Monti’s government. Emma Bonino wins the Foreign Minister post. She’s a former member of the European Parliament and and a leading member of the independent Italian Radicals Party. But there was no room for Beppe Grillo, the popular comedian who stood in the general election under his anti-establishment Five Star Movement.
