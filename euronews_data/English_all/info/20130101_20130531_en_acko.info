# ORIG CONTENT  South Korea’s new president Park Geun-hye has urged North Korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions, and to stop wasting its scarce resources on arms, less than two weeks after the country carried out its third nuclear test. In her inauguration speech, the country’s first female leader offered the impoverished and isolated neighbour aid and trade if it gave up its nuclear programme. “Trust can be built through dialogue and by honouring promises that have already been made,” she said. “It is my hope that North Korea will abide by international norms and make the right choice so that the trust-building process on the Korean peninsula can move forward,” she added. Park also called on South Koreans to help revive the nation’s export-dependent economy whose trade is threatened by neighbouring Japan’s weak yen policy. And the 70,000 strong crowd was also urged to move by rap sensation Psy, who performed his “Gangnam Style” hit, but without some of the raunchier actions.
