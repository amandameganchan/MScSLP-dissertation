# ORIG TITLE    Carlos the Jackal begins Paris appeal against life sentence . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Notorious communist militant Carlos the Jackal is appealing his life sentence in France. The Venezuelan, whose real name is Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, has asked the court in Paris to appoint a new lawyer. He has also asked Caracas to request extradition so he can return to his home country. Representative of victims of the attack, Françoise Rudetzki of SOS Attentats, said: “We don’t really expect anything from Carlos. I only hope that he’ll show more respect towards the victims than he did in his first trial when he described the victims as “only collateral damage”. I hope he has grown and thought about it, and that he won’t despise the victims anymore, but respect them, like we respect his right to appeal”. After being captured in Sudan in 1994, Carlos, 63, was convicted of murder for two attacks in the 1982 and 1983 in Marseille and Paris that killed 11 people. He had previously been convicted of triple murder in 1975. Carlos could face another trial for the deaths of two people during a 1974 Paris bombing of the Drugstore Saint-Germain.
