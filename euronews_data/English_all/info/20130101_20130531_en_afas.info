President Nicolas Maduro announced the arrest and warned of more to come: “We have captured an American who was financing violent groups. I have ordered the arrest of this man and we will try him. I have ordered the interior minister to arrest anyone seen in the video he filmed and any person involved in fascist violence against Venezuela.” . The arrested man has been identified as Timothy Hallett, he is accused of being a spy and connected to right-wing student groups. He was arrested at Caracas airport and police say they discovered incriminating photos and video in his apartment. The family of the detained say he is innocent and was in Venezuela filming a documentary.
