# ORIG TITLE    Serbia grants autonomy to ethnic Serbians in Kosovo . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Serbia’s parliament has paved the way for ethnic Serbians in Kosovo to be given autonomy within Kosovo’s legal framework. But the resolution brings fresh problems to EULEX, the EU civilian mission which supports the Kosovo authorities in the rule of law. Bernd Borchardt, the new head of EULEX told Euronews about the organisation’s objectives. “We support the implementation of the outcome of the political dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina. And secondly, in our executive work, we focus on what we call strengthening the technical advice of the Kosovan side, and facilitate the implementation of the rule of law in northern Kosovo. “ . The move by the Serbian parliament comes five years after Kosovo declared independence from Serbia and has been hailed a milestone. But despite pressure from the EU, the Serbian resolution still falls short of recognising Kosovo’s 1.7 million people as independent. EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton will chair talks between Serbian Prime Minister Ivica Dacic and Hashim Thaci, the Kosovan Prime Minister later this week, with a view to improving relations between the embattled neighbours.
