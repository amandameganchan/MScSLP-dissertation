# ORIG CONTENT  An early morning fire has killed five people including a child in an apartment block in France. The blaze in a Paris suburb took hold around four o’clock. Eighteen people including two firemen were injured. Seven people were rescued from the flames. The five victims shared a flat on the fourth floor of the seven-storey block in the town of Gennevilliers a deprived northern suburb of the capital. “I heard some screams around a quarter past four. I was looking at the other side and then I came to this side and I saw some smoke clouds. They came for sure from the garbage bins. Then I came down and as soon as I saw the flames, the firemen arrived,” explained one resident. The fire started on the fourth floor before spreading to the fifth. The Minister for the Interior and the Housing Minister have both visited the scene. About 100 firefighters fought the blaze. It’s unclear how it started.
