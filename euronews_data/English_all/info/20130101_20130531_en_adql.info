# ORIG TITLE    German and Italian presidents honour Nazi massacre victims . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Joachim Gauck has become the first German president to visit the site of one of the worst Nazi massacres in Italy. In August 1944 a unit of SS soldiers massacred over 500 people and burned the northern Tuscan town of Santâ€™Anna di Stazzema to the ground. Gauck held a memorial service with the Italian President Georgio Napolitano in a reconciliation effort that followed a diplomatic row involving former German soldiers. The massacre had been largely forgotten until 20-years-ago when a document was found in Rome sparking a fresh investigation. In 2004 an Italian court found the surviving eight SS soldiers guilty of crimes against humanity in absentia,but none of them served their sentences and in October 2012 a German court ended its investigation saying there was not enough proof to charge them.
