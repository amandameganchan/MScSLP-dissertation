# ORIG CONTENT  A mini bus has exploded at a crossing point between Turkey and Syria killing 14 people including Turkish citizens. Dozens more were wounded. It is believed the vehicle may have been packed with explosives. The border post is used by Syrian refugees fleeing the fighting in their homeland and is one of the main crossing points for humanitarian aid into Syria, . The incident happened on the Turkish side near the town of Reyhanli. The blast was meant to target a Syrian National Council opposition delegation, the group said on Tuesday, but the Turkish authorities said it was too early to apportion blame. “This is a terrorist act. We are working on several alternatives. It was probably carried out by a Syrian,” Turkish Interior Minister Muammer Guler told reporters in parliament. A statement by the Syrian National Council (SNC), an exile opposition group, said the bombing occurred as a delegation of the SNC leadership was expected to pass through the crossing on its way back from the Syrian city of Aleppo. Over the border at Tabqa, Syrian rebels claim to have captured a hydro-electric dam. According to a British based Syrian human rights group, Islamist fighters are in control of the dam which is Syria’s biggest. Although the move will have little impact on already patchy power supplies, opposition activists say it is more evidence of the growing pressure on President Bashar al Assad. Syrian opposition fighters have also captured a military airport near the northern city of Aleppo on Tuesday in another military setback for al-Assad’s forces. The airport is the latest military facility to fall under rebel control in a strategic region situated between Syria’s industrial and commercial centre and the country’s oil- and wheat- producing heartland to the east.
