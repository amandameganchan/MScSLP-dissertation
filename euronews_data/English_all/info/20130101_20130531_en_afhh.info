# ORIG TITLE    Portugal drinking ban stops teenagers getting too spirited . 
# ORIG CONTENT  In a bid to prevent excess teenage drinking, Portugal’s government has introduced a ban on the sale of spirits to anyone under 18 years old. Those under the age of 18 can legally only buy wine and beer, both of which have a lower alcohol content. Perhaps unsurprisingly, breweries are happy, but the country’s National Association of Spirits has called the move “ridiculous”. A representative for the group said: “All alcohol is equal, whether beer, wine or anything else.” . There has been a mixed reaction from the public. “When I was 16, I was able to buy this kind of alcohol and I don’t think I should have been able to. Young people should not start drinking so early,” said one man in Portugal who agreed with the new legislation. Another man said doesn’t agree with the new rules because he thinks young people should be allowed to enjoy their lives. Anywhere that sells or serves anyone underage could face a fine of up to 30,000 euros and be shut down for 12 hours at a time.
