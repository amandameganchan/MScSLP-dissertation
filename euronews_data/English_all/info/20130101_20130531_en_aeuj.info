# ORIG CONTENT  North Korea has moved two more short-range missile launchers to its east coast, according to a South Korean news agency. An unidentified military source said it indicates the possibility that Pyongyang is planning a missile test. Satellite imagery suggests the mobile missile launchers are for short-range Scud missiles. South Korea and its allies have been expecting a provocative act from Pyongyang after weeks of war talk on the Korean peninsula. Some analysts suggest that North Korea may well choose April 25 for a show of defiance to coincide with the anniversary of the formation of its army.
