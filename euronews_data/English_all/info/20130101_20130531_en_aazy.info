# ORIG TITLE    Paris haute couture: Gaultier and Valentino . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The Jean Paul Gaultier haute couture show in Paris was a riot of colour, all set to an Eastern soundtrack. But the highlight of the show was a completely impractical wedding dress complete with children hiding under the skirt and a papoose strapped to the model’s back. Jean Paul Gaultier: “This is a collection about like gypsy, gypsy of Rajasthan, but couture, couture chic, gypsy chic. So that is gypsy couture. So that was the idea. A patchwork of identity, a patchwork of clothes. And one advice: Take your old clothes, cut them all, and put them all together. You make a new one.” . Valentino also showed his haute couture collection for spring/summer 2013. Romantic and glamorous, the colour palette was muted and soft, with flashes of gold.
