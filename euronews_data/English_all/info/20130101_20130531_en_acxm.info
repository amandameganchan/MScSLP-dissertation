# ORIG CONTENT  As Venezuela prepares for the funeral of its charismatic leader Hugo Chavez, authorities are making arrangements for his body to lie in state for an extra week. Authorities believe millions of people still want to file past his coffin. Like Lenin, his embalmed body will be put on display. Iran’s president was among at least two dozen heads of state expected at the funeral. Chavez was one of the few world leaders still friends with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.The pair shared a disdain for the United States. Other left-wing Latin American allies arrived too – Raul Castro from Cuba, where Chavez had received so much treatment for the cancer that finally claimed his life. Brazil’s leaders past and present, Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff also paid their respects at the Chavez coffin. And the Ecuadorean president Rafael Correa was among the group of leaders that will also include the President of Belarus Alexander Lukachenko.
