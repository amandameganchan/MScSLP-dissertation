# ORIG TITLE    Ruby testifies on Berlusconi’s ‘Bunga Bunga’ parties . 
# ORIG CONTENT  She is the Moroccan woman at the centre of a sex scandal involving former Italian Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi. In court, Karima el-Mahroug testified for the first time describing Berlusconi’s so-called ‘Bunga Bunga’ parties. She said a young woman danced while dressed as a Catholic nun and then stripped for the then Prime Minister. But today’s trial is separate from one in which the 76-year-old is charged with paying for sex with an underage prostitute and covering it up, which he denies. Away from the media mogul, the trial focused on three of his former aides charged with soliciting Ruby and other women for prostitution. Nicole Minetti, former show girl turned politician, Italian talent agent Lele Mora and former news programme director, Emilio Fede, the third defendant. All three deny the charges. Both Berlusconi and Ms el-Mahroug known as ‘Ruby the heart stealer’ deny having had sex. She admits receiving 7,000 euros after a party but claims it was merely a gift.
