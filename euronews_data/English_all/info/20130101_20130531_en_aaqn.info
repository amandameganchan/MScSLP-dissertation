# ORIG TITLE    Obama reveals his plans for gun control . 
# ORIG CONTENT  US President Barack Obama has announced his proposals for new gun control measures a month after 26 people were shot dead at Sandy Hook elementary school in Connecticut. Speaking from the White House the democratic president announced 23 executive actions which do not require congressional approval. But said the only real change can be achieved with its help: . “As important as these steps are they are in no way a substitute for action from members of the Congress,” he said. “To make a real and lasting difference Congress too must act. First it’s time for Congress to require a universal background check for anyone trying to buy a gun; Second, Congress should restore a ban on military style assault weapons and a 10 round limit magazines. The US has one of the highest rates of civilian gun ownership in the world. By taking this stance the President looks set for a showdown with firearms rights advocates who see any restriction of firearms as against the second amendment of the US constitution, the right to bear arms.
