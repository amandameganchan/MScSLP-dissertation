# ORIG CONTENT  People in Caracas continue to gather to call for more news about their president’s health. There has been neither sight nor sound of Venezuela’s Hugo Chavez since he underwent a fourth operation for cancer in December. The 58-year-old’s recovery at a hospital in Cuba has been complicated by a lung infection. Now, his January the 10th inauguration has now been postponed indefinitely by the Supreme Court. The opposition plans to challenge that decision at the regional human rights court in Costa Rica. It violates the constitution according to opposition politician Gerardo Blyde who says action will be necessary once people realise that. Regional leaders like Ollanta Humala from Peru have travelled to Cuba to visit the ailing president. Adan Chavez has dismissed claims that his younger brother is in a coma. Venezuela’s vice president is also in Cuba for meetings with the Chavez family and medical team.
