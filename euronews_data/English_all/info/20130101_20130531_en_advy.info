# ORIG CONTENT  North Korea has ignored international calls for calm and announced it is entering what it says is a ‘state of war’ with South Korea. The escalation in rhetoric follows similar tough talking against the US in which it said it was readying rockets to attack US bases in the Pacific region. Analysts claim the threat against the South has to be seen in context as both sides have technically been in a state of war since 1953 when the Korean conflict ended in an armistice and not a peace treaty. Tensions have been high since North Korea carried out a third nuclear test in February. The subsequent sanctions angered Pyongyang which recently cut a military hotline with the South – the last direct official link between the two nations.
