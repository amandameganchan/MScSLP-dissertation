# ORIG CONTENT  In the aftermath of the Mother’s Day shooting in New Orleans, the motive for the attack is still not clear. Nineteen people, including two children were hurt when one or more people opened fire on the crowd following the main procession. The injuries are said to be not life-threatening, although a number of people required surgery. The Mayor of New Orleans, Mitch Landrieu, told reporters that the police were working really hard on finding the people responsible and asked for help from the public: “there were hundreds of people there – and somebody saw something,” he said. The attacks took place in a deprived area of New Orleans, which is still recovering from the effects of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and which suffers from some of the highest levels of gun crime in the US. The incident comes hot on the heels of a failed attempt by President Obama to introduce checks on people buying guns over the internet.
