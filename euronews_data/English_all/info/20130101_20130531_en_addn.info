# ORIG TITLE    Pope Francis faces challenge of reforming Curia . 
# ORIG CONTENT  When Jorge Mario Bergoglio became Pope Francis on March 13 he took over the oldest and largest institution on earth – the Roman Catholic Church. The Pope is a spiritual leader, a policy maker and also the ruler of the Vatican city – a sovereign state, with its own government, financial institutions and court system. One of Francis’ key challenges will be reforming the Curia, the administrative body that operates it all. Critics, including some inside the Vatican itself, say the Curia is inefficient and needs to be modernised. It has also been losing money – posting a deficit in 2011.
