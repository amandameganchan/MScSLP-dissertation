# ORIG TITLE    J-Lo shows she’s still got in ‘Parker’ . 
# ORIG CONTENT  J-Lo is back on the silver screen in Taylor Hackford’s thriller “Parker”. The Oscar-winning director has tackled a number of genres over the past four decades, from documentary to horror – and is perhaps best known for his biopic “Ray” – but this is his first film noir. In “Parker” Jason Statham plays a thief who teams up with a savvy insider played by Jennifer Lopez to take revenge on a crew who double-crossed him. The film premiered in New York , the 43-year-old singer, actress and mother Jennifer Lopez praised its director: . “This has real characters and real-life situations. And I think Taylor had a lot to do with that and making it feel a little bit gritty and real. I would say it’s like ‘Transporter’ and ‘Out of Sight’ had a baby and it’s ‘Parker.’ It has different dimensions than with just the regular action film.” . Along with Statham (Transporter) . (the Expendibles), the thriller features American singer and actress Patti Ann LuPone, known for her Tony Award-winning performance as Eva Perón in the 1979 stage musical Evita and for her Olivier Award-winning performance as Fantine in the original London cast of Les Misérables. Both actors said they got on well with their Latino co-star. “Well we were working together so everyone’s on the same level,” said Statham. “Yeah, everyone comes in, we’re all doing a job, no one pretends to be something that they’re not. So everything’s just as it should be.” . Patti LuPone said: “She’s great. She’s very professional, absolutely beautiful. I was telling somebody today that when I was off camera looking at the video at her close up, she doesn’t have a bad angle. “She’s like Ingrid Bergman. Everybody’s got a good side and a bad side, she has only gorgeous sides. She’s so beautiful and she’s a very professional worker and that was very impressive.” . “Parker” will be in cinemas across Europe at different times between January 25 and the end of April.
