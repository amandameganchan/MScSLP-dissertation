# ORIG CONTENT  Barack Obama says the United States is investigating whether chemical weapons have been used in Syria – and has warned that the regime will be held responsible if they have. At joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem, Obama said: “We have been clear that the use of chemical weapons against the Syrian people would be a serious and tragic mistake. “We also share Israel’s grave concern about the transfer of chemical or other weapon systems to terrorists, such as Hezbollah. They might be used against Israel. The Assad regime must understand that they would be held accountable for the use of chemical weapons or their transfer to terrorists”, Obama continued. Reports emerged on March 19 that chemical weapons may have entered the Syrian conflict – with both the government and rebels accusing the other side of a chemical attack in Aleppo province. The long-stalled Middle East peace process and Iran’s nuclear intentions are also key issues for discussion. Obama will visit the Palestinian territories on March 21.
