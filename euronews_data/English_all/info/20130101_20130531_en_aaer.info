# ORIG CONTENT  Egypt’s Coptic Christians celebrate Christmas for the first time since Muslim Brotherhood president Mohammed Mursi came to power. The minority group mark the holy event against the backdrop of a newly-finalised constitution without input from liberal and Christian members of the assembley after they walked out in protest. It is also the first Christmas in charge for Pope Tawadros II – ordained in mid-November. Many of Egypt’s Coptic Christians are worried about the future, according to Youssef Sidhom, Editor-in-chief at Coptic Christian Egyptian weekly newspaper Watani. “Copts have many concerns and worries about what hidden intentions lie between the lines in the constitution and what are they going to be expecting as legislation that may change their lives,” he said. Even before the ousting of former president Hosni Mubarak, 21 people were killed in a church in Alexandria on January 1, 2011. Al Qaeda was blamed for the attack. The fear is that Christians, who make up about 10 percent of the population, could now face more attacks and discrimination.
