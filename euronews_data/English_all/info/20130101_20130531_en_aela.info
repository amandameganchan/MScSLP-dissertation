# ORIG TITLE    EU approves Cyprus bailout . 
# ORIG CONTENT  As Europe’s finance ministers arrived for a meeting in Dublin, we learned that Cyprus does need more money for its bailout but that will not come from the EU and the International Monetary Fund. That follows reports the 17 billion euro bailout total had swelled to 23 billion. The Cypriot finance minister Haris Georgiades would only say: “We look forward to the political endorsement of the Cyprus programme and we are ready to start work for the recovery.” . He was asked: “Will we need another deal? Are we talking about another 5.5 billion euros?” . “We have a deal and we shall make it work,” Georgiades replied. The ministers backed the Cyprus bailout – to the tune of 10 billion euros – saying any extra money must come from things like the levy on larger bank account holders, along with budget cuts and asset sales. “The programme is going to be 10 billion, as agreed, and all the other elements in the programme will be financed either from the bail-in in the banks, privatisation and other elements in the programme so there’s no surprise there,“said Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem. Finding more money for its bank bailout means the Cypriot economy will be further depressed; to counter that Nicosia is asking for early payments of EU structural funds used to co-finance projects in the region’s less developed countries to help them expand economically. Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades told reporters in Nicosia on Friday that he would send a letter to European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and European Council President Herman Van Rompuy asking for extra assistance because of the bad economic situation of the island. The EU and IMF have forecast Cyprus’ GDP will contract almost nine percent this year and almost four percent in 2014 before returning to growth in 2015.
