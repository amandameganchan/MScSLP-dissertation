# ORIG CONTENT  Brussels has sounded the alarm over Spain and Slovenia’s economies. A European Commission report warned that they face huge problems to overcome their financial woes. The report suggests either recapitalising or winding down their ailing banks. The EU Commissioner for Economic Affairs, Olli Rehn noted that despite progress in Spain last year, “there are still excessive macroeconomic imbalances. Spain should therefore maintain the reform momentum.” . Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy downplayed the comments, noting that the figures used in the report were outdated. However, he did say that new reforms were needed and are scheduled to be announced on April 26th. Eighteen months into a recession which has left 26 per cent of the population jobless, Spaniards are unlikely to take any new austerity measures lying down.
