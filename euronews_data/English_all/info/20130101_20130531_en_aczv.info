# ORIG TITLE    Syrian airforce bombs Homs . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Syrian warplanes have bombed the shattered Baba Amr district of Homs, a day after rebels made a surprise push into their former bastion. Syriaâ€™s third biggest city, Homs has been in army hands for one year. It has seen major fighting in the revolt against President Bashar al-Assad. According to opposition sources, the Sunni rebels broke through army lines in the north and west of Homs on Sunday to loosen a months-long military siege on their strongholds, 140 km north of Damascus. Homs lies on a road juncture linking army bases on the Mediterranean coast and government forces in the capital. Assad appears to be focusing his military campaign on holding the main cities along a highway axis running north of Homs to Hama and Aleppo and south to Damascus and Deraa.
