He then spent his years in power promoting racial reconciliation, despite having spent nearly three decades in prison. Father Sebastian Russouw from the Regina Parish church in Soweto said: “We pray that God’s healing hand may be upon him, that he knows God’s closeness is with him at all times.” . It is the third time in four months that Mandela has been in hospital. He has a history of lung problems since contracting tuberculosis as a prisoner.
