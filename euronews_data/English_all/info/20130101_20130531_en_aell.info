# ORIG TITLE    Malawi slams Madonna as “uncouth” . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The government in Malawi has hit out at Madonna, branding the pop star an “uncouth bully who exaggerates her charitable work in the country” and demands red carpet treatment when she visits. The singer dismissed the 11-point statement as lies, and said the attack was more to do with her firing of the president’s sister from her charity, “Raising Malawi”.
