# ORIG CONTENT  The UN security council has voted unanimously to tighten sanctions against North Korea after the latest nuclear tests. Even China, North Korea’s only major ally, said it wanted to see the measures ‘fully implemented.’ . They include much stricter financial restrictions, and a tougher line on attempts to receive and ship banned cargoes. North Korea’s government stepped up the rhetoric, threatening a pre-emptive nuclear strike on the United States, and it scrapped the armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953. Selected North Koreans in Pyongyang added their voice too. “Our enemies are staging extra large scale war exercises, mobilising multi-national forces,” this man said. “We can make good use of this chance, and resolutely retaliate against our enemies and achieve national reunification and turn the United States and South Korea into a sea of flames.” . “We will make a pre-emptive nuclear attack against our enemies wherever they are and turn their strongholds into a sea of flames,” said another. North Korea has infuriated much of the international community with its tests. In December it launched a missile in defiance of warnings, and last month scientists carried out the country’s third nuclear test.
