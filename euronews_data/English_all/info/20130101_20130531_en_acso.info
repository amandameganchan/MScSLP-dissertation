# ORIG CONTENT  Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II is being treated in hospital in London for the symptoms of the stomach complaint gastroenteritis. The 86-year-old monarch developed symptoms on Friday and was taken to hospital as a precaution. Her Majesty is expected to stay in hospital for a couple of days. The coming week’s engagements, including a trip to Italy, have been cancelled or postponed. “To be honest, we’re very worried, you know.” admitted one well-wisher outside Buckingham Palace. “She’s been so, so good not just to UK people but also to people around the world.” . The British head of state, who last year celebrated 60 years on the throne, is renowned for her robust heath. Reporting from outside the hospital in London, Euronews correspondent Ali May said: “If you are looking for a living symbol of the good old “Keep Calm and Carry On” poster, it has got to be the Queen herself. She may be 86 but she rarely cancels an engagement and the last time she was in hospital was 10 years ago for a knee operation.” .
