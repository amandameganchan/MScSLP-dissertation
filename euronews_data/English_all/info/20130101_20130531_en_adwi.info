# ORIG CONTENT  Pope Francis has used his first Easter Sunday address to plea for peace in the world. He delivered his speech from the central balcony of St Peterâ€™s Basilica, Vatican City, to a crowd estimated to be a quarter-of-a-million strong. The pontiff called for peace between Israelis and Palestinians, an end to the civil war in Syria and for political solutions to conflicts in several African countries. He also referred to the crisis on the Korean peninsula, calling for disagreements to be overcome. Francis, who has brought a more simple and personal style to the papacy, said the message of Easter is that faith can help people transform their lives. Easter Sunday is the day Christians believe Jesus was resurrected from the dead.
