# ORIG TITLE    Syrian opposition chief resigns . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The head of Syria’s main opposition group resigned on Sunday. Moaz Alkhatib was picked to lead the Western and Gulf-backed National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces in November. His departure comes after the coalition berated him for offering President Bashar al-Assad an exit deal. It also follows moves by the group, despite Alkhatib’s objections, to form a provisional government. The coalition chose Islamist leaning technocrat Ghassan Hitto as a provisional prime minister to fill a power vacuum in Syria. In a statement, Alkhatib said that he had promised to resign if matters reached “red lines.” . “Now I am fulfilling my promise and announcing my resignation from the National Coalition,” he said, “in order to be able to work with freedom that cannot be available within official institutions.” .
