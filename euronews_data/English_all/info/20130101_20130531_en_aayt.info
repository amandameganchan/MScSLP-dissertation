# ORIG TITLE    Micro-algae is new energy source . 
# ORIG CONTENT  In the Ennesys Lab in Nanterre, France, researchers are working on a project to produce energy from waste water by cultivating micro-algae in order to heat water and provide heating. Waste water contains organic pollution and this makes an ideal fertilizer for micro-algae which given the correct amount of light will flourish and grow. Jean-Louis Kindler, Director General of Ennesys explained: “We collect waste water from this building and we dilute this water so that micro-algae can live in it and consume the pollution found in waste water. The micro-algae grows and then we separate them and produce oil and vegetable biomass which is recuperated. This oil can can be used as a fuel as we’re doing here with this lamp, to produce energy either in the form of heat, or in the form of electricity. Here, feel the heat.” . To achieve this result, the researchers have installed photobioreactors on the roof, these transparent tubes filled with what will become green fuel. Exposed to the light, the micro-algae grows very fast. Lauren Robelin, the project director at Ennesys, said: “Before, we used centrifugal force to extract the algae but this uses a lot of energy so now we have a low-energy solution which involves electromagnets to separate the algae from the water.” . The fuel produced this way contains the same energy value as coal. And at the end, the water is the same quality as rain water. 80% of a building’s energy needs can be produced this way and the good news is that the system is carbon neutral.
