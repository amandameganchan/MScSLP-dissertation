# ORIG CONTENT  Syrian state TV showed a cache of arms allegedly supplied to rebels from outside the country. The ‘find’ came on a day when French President Francois Hollande called on the EU to lift its arms embargo on the country to assist anti-Assad fighters. Hollande was in Brussels ahead of a meeting of EU leaders. He said the UK supported the move, but other EU countries needed to be convinced.

Faruk Tayfor is a member of the Syrian National Council: . “Of course, such support would help to shorten our way on the road to victory. We thank all the countries that support us and we believe that victory will be on our side as soon as possible.” .
