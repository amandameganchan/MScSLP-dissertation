# ORIG CONTENT  An investigation has been launched in Chile after thousands of dead prawns washed up on a beach in Coronel City. Experts are investigating if a change in temperature or oxygen levels is the cause for the disaster which also caused hundreds of crabs to be washed ashore. Local fisherman from the city, around 500 kilometres from the capital, Santiago, blamed nearby power stations that use seawater as a cooling agent. Others indicated it could have been caused by the El Nino phenomenon, which warms the waters of the Pacific.
