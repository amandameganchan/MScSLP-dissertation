# ORIG TITLE    US and UK leaders warn Syria over WMDs . 
# ORIG CONTENT  US President Barack Obama has given a staunch warning to the Syrian leader, Bashar al-Assad, saying the US would respond if his forces were found to be using weapons of mass destruction: . “It’s obviously horrific,” he said. “As it is when mortars are being fired on civilians and people are being indiscriminately killed.” . “To use potential weapons of mass destruction on civilian populations crosses another line with respect to international norms and international law, and that is going to be a game changer.” . A day earlier the White House said it believed Assad’s forces had used chemical weapons on a small scale. British Prime Minister David Cameron mirrored the words of his American counterpart. He also said the use of chemical weapons is a red line, though learning important lessons from the past he expressed the need to gather more evidence before getting fired up over WMDs: . “Do I think that putting boots on the ground in Syria, as we did in Iraq or Afghanistan, is the right thing to do? No I don’t, and I don’t think we should do it.” . “Should we be working with our allies, the French, Americans, others in the Gulf, to do everything we can to support the responsible part of the opposition? Yes we should.” .
