# ORIG CONTENT  There has been a powerful explosion at a skyscraper in the heart of Mexico City that has left at least 25 people dead and injured 100 more. Dozens of other employees are reported to be trapped inside the building. It happened at the headquarters of Mexico’s giant oil company Pemex as staff were preparing to leave work for the day. One employee emerged from the 50-storey building to say it felt like an earthquake had struck. Emergency services cordoned off the area around the building. It is the latest in a series of fatal safety incidents to have hit Mexico’s oil monopoly. One rescue worker thought the blast was due to a gas build-up. Another report suggested that a machinery room on the lower floors of the skyscraper had blown up. Mexico’s interior minister visited the scene and warned that the number of dead could rise.
