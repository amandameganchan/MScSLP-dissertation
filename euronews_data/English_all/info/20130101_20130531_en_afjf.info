# ORIG TITLE    One World Trade Center becomes tallest in the West . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The spire atop One World Trade Center has been hoisted into place filling the void left on the New York skyline by the attacks on September 11th, 2001. The tower is one of four that will be built around the site of the Twin Towers. Once a beacon is installed, it will stand 541 metres high, making it the tallest building in the Western hemisphere, taking that title from Chicago’s Willis Tower. It is however way behind other tall buildings that can be found in the Middle East and Asia. The tallest building at the moment is Dubai’s Burj Khalifa which stands at 828 metres tall. Wheras the whopping, still under construction, Kingdom Tower in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, is set to stand at more than one kilometre when completed. The footprints of the fallen towers have been turned into a memorial to the nearly 3,000 people killed in the 2001 attacks by al Qaeda hijackers. One World Trade Center, formerly called the Freedom Tower, is estimated to have cost more than $3 billion (2.3 billion euros) and is due to open next year. It will have three million square feet (278,000 square metres) of office space, an observation deck, shops and restaurants.
