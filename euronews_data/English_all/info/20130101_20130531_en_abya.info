# ORIG TITLE    Stricken liner close to safety . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The ordeal is almost over for more than 4,200 people who have been trapped on a crippled cruise liner since Sunday. A fire on the Carnival Triumph left the vessel adrift in the Gulf of Mexico. The toilets on board were reported to be overflowing and a coastguard helicopter had to fly in an emergency generator. Tugs have now managed to tow the ship closer to safety and they are manouevring into the port of Mobile in Alabama. Some passengers have been able to send texts and make calls. Nelly Betts, whose daughter is on board, said: “I am sad. I am depressed. I’m devastated. I’m very devastated. This has been going on too long. I know they could have had them home by now. It’s just been awful.” . The vessel left Galveston in Texas a week ago, and had been due back there on Monday. The head of Carnival Cruise lines has promised passengers 375 euros each in compensation for what he called “very challenging circumstances.” .
