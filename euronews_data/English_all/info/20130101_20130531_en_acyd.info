# ORIG TITLE    Violence continues in Egypt following sentence of football fans . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Unrest is continuing in Egypt after a court in Cairo upheld the death sentences handed down to 21 fans over football riots in Port Said in February 2012. About 2,000 protesters blocked car ferries from crossing the Suez Canal this morning . The city at the northern entrance to the canal has witnessed several eruptions of violence since the announcement of the death sentences in January on the local fans for their role in the deaths of more than 70 people. Meanwhile in Cairo, football fans of Alhawys club, who lost 72 of their fans in the riot, celebrated the ruling. However, they too caused violence by setting fire to a police social club, with plumes of smoke billowing out over the capital. They consider insufficient the sentences of 15 years in prison for two of the police implicated in the deaths. These incidents have coincided with police officers holding strikes in various cities across Egypt.
