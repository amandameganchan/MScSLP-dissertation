# ORIG TITLE    Obama holds scaled back inauguration . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The US presidential couple rounded off inauguration day with a turn on the dance floor at a celebratory ball. This time around there were only two formal inaugural balls, down from 10 in 2009. Earlier, the couple had thrilled onlookers by twice getting out of their armoured limousine to greet the crowds on Pennsylvania Avenue. Obama’s ceremonial swearing-in at the US Capitol was filled with the traditional pomp and pageantry, but it was a scaled-back inauguration compared with 2009, when he swept into office on a wave of hope and change as America’s first black president. While the crowds on the National Mall were enthusiastic, it is clear the euphoria of 2009 has gone.
