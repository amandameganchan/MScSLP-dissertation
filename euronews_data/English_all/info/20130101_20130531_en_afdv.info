# ORIG CONTENT  Rescuers trying to find more survivors from the collapsed factory building in Bangladesh have been further hampered by an outbreak of fire. Smoke was seen from a hole where attempts were being made to pull out a trapped woman. At least 377 people have been killed in the tragedy with hundreds more still missing. One rescuer described what happened: “The fire began as soon as engineers started to operate a grinding machine. It was a big fire. My colleagues moved out with great difficulty. Now all of us are out. Allah knows what happened to the girl… “ . Factory owner Mohammed Sohel Rana was earlier arrested trying to flee to India. He is one of six people who have now been detained. They are all facing charges of faulty construction and causing unlawful death. Anger at the building collapse has triggered days of violent protests in the capital Dhaka. The eight story building had not been approved and was erected on a filled in pond, weakening its foundations. Hope is fading of finding any one else alive beneath the rubble.
