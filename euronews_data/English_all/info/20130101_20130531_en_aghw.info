# ORIG CONTENT  The family of the soldier killed on the streets of South London on Wednesday say they had come to terms with the possibility of losing him while he served in Afghanistan – but never expected him to be killed on their “doorstep”. Lee Rigby’s relatives held an emotional press conference at the regimental headquarters of his unit in Bury, near Manchester. “I just want to say that I love Lee, I always will, and I’m proud to be his wife. He was due to come home this weekend to continue our future together as a family. He was a devoted father to our son Jack and we’ll both miss him terribly,” said Rigby’s tearful widow, Rebecca Rigby . The dead soldier’s wife said his proudest moments had been taking part in ceremonials in London. Reading out a letter written by his other children, his step-father Ian Rigby said: “Courtney and Amy, his younger sisters, wrote this for Lee: ‘Rest in peace Lee. We loved you so much and you didn’t deserve this. You fought for your country and did it well. You will always be our hero, we are just upset you left us so early. We love you Lee, goodnight’.” .
