# ORIG CONTENT  The Dow Jones index has extended its record-breaking run by closing modestly higher but still at another record. The index rose 42.47 points to finish unofficially at 14,296. Investors are betting that the favourable market conditions will continue. US Data shows a steady manufacturing sector and strong gains in private employment supported equity markets. However concerns the rally may run out of steam in the short term means the gains were slight.
