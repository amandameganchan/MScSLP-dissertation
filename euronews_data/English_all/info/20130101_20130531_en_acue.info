# ORIG TITLE    Lara Croft Tomb Raider: game on . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Lara Croft is back in the latest “Tomb Raider” video game but she’s been stripped of her previous history and reinvented as a 21-year-old novice. The game is set on an island where Lara and her archaeological team are shipwrecked while looking for a lost city . Instead of the usual iconic Lara oozing confidence and panache in this version she begins as a terrified young woman who is desperate to survive. Lara’s appearance has also changed since 1996 – she’s now lost some of her exaggerated curves and she’s wearing trousers instead of shorts. The new “Tomb Raider” game is already out in the USA and the UK.
