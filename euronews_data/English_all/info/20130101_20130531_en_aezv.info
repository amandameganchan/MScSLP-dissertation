# ORIG TITLE    Historical minaret in Aleppo is latest casualty in Syrian conflict . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The fighting in Syria is taking a toll on the country’s cultural sites. UN cultural agency UNESCO says five out of Syria’s six World Heritage sites have been damaged. The latest devastation happened to the 11th-century minaret of the Umayyad Mosque in Aleppo – the scene of heavy fighting since last July. Syrian state television is blaming rebels from the al-Qaeda-linked Jabhat al-Nusra, claiming the minaret was blown up. The rebel Free Syria Army says the minaret was destroyed by an army tank shell. The opposition have lost control of Otaiba – a strategic town to the east of Damascus. Government forces have pushed the rebels out, breaking a key supply route for weapons. Opposition fighters there say they called on rebels in neighbouring areas, but no help came – an indication of how divisions within the opposition are hampering efforts on the ground.
