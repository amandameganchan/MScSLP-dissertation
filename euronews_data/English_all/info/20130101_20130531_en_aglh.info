# ORIG CONTENT  US President Barack Obama described the destruction caused by last week’s tornado in Oklahoma as ‘hard to comprehend’. He made the remarks while on his first visit to the town of Moore where 24 people lost their lives. Standing by a pile of debris that was once an elementary school, President Obama promised long-term federal help in rebuilding: . “I’m confident that resources will be forthcoming when it comes to rebuilding. But remember that it’s also the ongoing training and equipment that we’re making sure that those things are in place. We can’t shortchange that kind of ongoing disaster response. We can’t just wait until the disaster happens. That’s how, in part, we were able to save a lot of lives.” . The tornado which struck Moore was the deadliest to hit the United States in two years. It left behind a 27 kilometre-long corridor of destruction flattening up to 1200 homes. It is estimated to have caused up to five billion dollars worth of insured losses (3.8 billion euros).
