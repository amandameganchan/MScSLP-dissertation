# ORIG TITLE    Portugal allows gay adoption . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Portugual has become the latest country to allow homosexual couples to adopt, three years after it allowed them to marry. The adoption will be of a limited form, restricted to children belonging to either member of a couple, but gay campaigners described it as significant progress in improving legal protection for children of same-sex unions.
