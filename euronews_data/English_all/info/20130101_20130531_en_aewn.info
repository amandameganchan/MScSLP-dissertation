# ORIG CONTENT  Two men accused of plotting an attack on a passenger train that links Toronto and New York have appeared in separate courts. Chiheb Esseghaier, a Tunisian born doctoral student, was in the dock in Montreal. He told Quebec judge Pierre Labelle that conclusions had been drawn from deeds and words that “are only appearances.” . In Toronto Palestinian Raed Jaser did not enter a plea. The charges include conspiring to carry out an attack and murder people in association with a terrorist group. In the capital Ottawa the Muslim Coordinating Council felt compelled to denounce violence: “You have nothing to do with our faith. Like all Canadians, we want to feel safe and protected in our own country, and while some have raised concerns about a potential backlash, we fully trust that our fellow citizens will see this for what it is: the alleged criminal and misguided actions of a few who do not reflect or represent Canadian Muslim communities,” said Chairman Azhar Ali Khan. Canadian investigators allege that the pair received “directions and guidance” from al Qaeda in Iran. Tehran reacted swiftly saying al Qaeda and Iran hold opposing philosophies. Iran is a shi’ite led state and al Qaeda a Sunni Arab terrorist network.
