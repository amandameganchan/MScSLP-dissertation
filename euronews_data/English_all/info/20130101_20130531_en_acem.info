# ORIG TITLE    Madrid kicks off fashion week . 
# ORIG CONTENT  In Madrid, a cohort of scantily clad models frantically busy themselves in a blur of clothes, lipstick, designers and make-up artists. They’re getting ready to hit the runway for Madrid Fashion Week. Nuria Sarda is Creative Director at Andres Sarda, one of the designers of the show. Her collection features some items of lingerie.“Lingerie often has the same effect as doing your hair, wearing perfume or makeup … it’s about morale. It’s just as important to feel as good on the inside as on the outside.” . A total of 42 designers will present their collections on the catwalk this year. And they’re always looking for new ways to showcase their talents. Francis Montesino is another of the fashion designers attending. His collection drew from some distinct themes. “We started with a ‘Made in Spain’ collection inspired by the Las Ventas bullring. This vinyl dress was photographed by Helmut Newton,” he told euronews, pulling a dress from a rack. And he showed off another intricately made dress inlaid with little pieces of glass. Twenty young up-and-coming designers also have the chance to display their collections in a separate showroom. According to the director of Madrid Fashion Week, Leonor Pérez Pita, Director, Madrid ranks high on the global list of fashion events. “Paris, Milan and New York obviously take the spoils … and we then occupy a worthy fourth place with London.” . This is the 57th edition of Madrid Fashion Week. A self-confessed underdog to the bigger players, last year’s event still attracted a crowd of 30,000 people. Organisers will be hoping the designers create enough of a buzz for just as big a turnout again.
