# ORIG TITLE    Boston Marathon blasts aftermath . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Boston is still reeling from two explosions which struck the annual marathon on Monday. The latest count puts the number of wounded at 176 with 17 in a critical condition. An eight-year old boy was among the three who were killed by the blast. Hospitals in Massachusetts are treating many for lower leg and shrapnel injuries. The bombs which were detonated by the finishing line within 13 seconds of one another were said to be packed with ball bearings to maximise damage. For those who were at the finish line, it is a day that will remain etched in their memories. A news photographer who was at the finish line relived the moment the blasts hit: “I’ve got that image and that sound. I’ll never forget the sound and I’ll never forget the imagery I saw when I approached before the second bomb went off and I’ll just never forget that mayhem that was going on during that time.” . Runners now feel the event has been changed forever. Security has been stepped up in Washington and New York, and Boston is still on high alert. For now, Americans are beginning to mourn the worst attack on their soil since 9/11.
