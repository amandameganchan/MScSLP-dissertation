# ORIG TITLE    Supplies fly in to Mali as UN warns of suffering . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Eleven days after the beginning of Operation Serval in Mali, US supply planes have begun arriving in Bamako. American transport planes have arrived on the runway at Bamako – but French soldiers are getting out. There have been five such flights so far, bringing a total of 140 tonnes of equipment and 80 personnel. At UN level, Secretary General Ban Ki-moon warned against compromising the organisation’s neutrality. “Mali is under threat from terrorists with regional and global repercussions. Addressing these challenges requires political, security and humanitarian efforts. At the same time in calibrating the extent of its own involvement, the United Nations has to carefully take into account the human rights, safety and security issues at stake.” . The UN says the humanitarian situation is another worry. Thousands of people have been forced from their homes over the past 10 days as the fighting has increased. An estimated 230,000 people are now displaced across the country.
