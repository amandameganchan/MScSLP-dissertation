# ORIG TITLE    Civil disobedience brings Port Said to a stop . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Access to state buildings, public transport and the harbour has been blocked in the Egyptian city of Port Said. It is a day of civil disobedience, led by protesters demanding justice for the deaths of dozens killed in riots last month. The violence was triggered by news of death sentences handed down to 21 people from Port Said for their involvement in the football stadium disaster a year ago in which 74 died. “We have called on the government to bring justice for the martyrs,“one man told reporters, “but there has been no response. No one is listening to us, everyone is very angry.” . More than 50 people died and hundreds were injured in clashes with the police which followed the announcement of the verdict last month. Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi brought in a state of emergency and a curfew in Port Said and two other towns along the Suez Canal in an attempt to contain the violence.
