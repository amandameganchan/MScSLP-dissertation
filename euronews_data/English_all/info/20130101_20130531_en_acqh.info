# ORIG TITLE    Apple suffers setback in damages battle with Samsung . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Hi-tech giant Samsung has welcomed a US court ruling ordering $1bn ( 762m euros) damages awarded to Apple last year to be cut by 40 per cent. A California judge ruled the original amount set by a jury was based on incorrect calculations. Apple won the award last year against Samsung in what was the biggest and highest-profile of a number of legal trials around the world. They centred on the use and alleged abuse of patents in the highly competitive mobile phone market. Apple claims Samsung has infringed on its iPhone along with its iPad patents. However the ruling means the two are set to meet in court again. The 40 per cent removed from the payout will be reassessed and could be increased or lowered at a future trial. Between them the two firms sell one in every two mobile phones worldwide..
