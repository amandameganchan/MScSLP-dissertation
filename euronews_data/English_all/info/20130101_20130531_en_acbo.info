# ORIG TITLE    Reader’s Digest in trouble again . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The parent company of Reader’s Digest is filing for bankruptcy protection from its creditors for the second time in three and a half years. The 91-year-old magazine is labouring under nearly 350 million euros worth of debt and, like other traditional print operations, is struggling to cope with a shift by readers to electronic media. RDA Holding Co. said a reorganisation of its finances should mean it can keep publishing the magazine worldwide, as well as three other titles it owns.
