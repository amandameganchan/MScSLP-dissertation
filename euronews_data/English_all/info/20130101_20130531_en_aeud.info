The relationship hit an all time low in 2010 when Israel attacked a Gaza-bound aid flotilla that left eight Turks dead and one Turkish American.

John Kerry was pains to highlight a rare Israeli apology: “That was a courageous decision made by the prime minister of Israel, to move forward in that relationship, and I believe that Prime Minister Erdogan and Foreign Minister Davutoglu are deeply committed to fulfilling all the obligations of that understanding,” he said. Kerry also implored Erdogan not to undertake a planned trip to the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip a move backed by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Kerry believes the window of opportunity for a two-state solution of the Israel-Palestinian conflict is closing quickly and he wants to move fast to find some kind of resolution.
