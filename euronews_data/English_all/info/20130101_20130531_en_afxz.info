I heard glass shattering and I knew my house was going. And we looked up and then, like, on top of the bathtub the whole ceiling was gone. And that was when we knew we were, we were probably gone, we were in trouble.” . Rescue workers are continuing to comb through wreckage searching for the seven people thought to be missing.
