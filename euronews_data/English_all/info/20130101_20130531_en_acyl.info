# ORIG TITLE    Maze on course for World Cup grand slam . 
# ORIG CONTENT  This season’s form skier Tina Maze put herself on track for a grand slam of crystal globes with victory in the slalom at Ofterschwang Germany. Maze was second after the morning run but fought back in style in the second to snatch her 10th victory of the World Cup season, her second in a slalom. The Slovenian’s win lifted her to the top of the world cup slalom standings and also increased her all-time points record in the overall World Cup standings to 2.254. Maze remains in contention to win all four discipline World Cups on top of the overall title. In the slalom standings she now leads second-placed Mikaela Shiffrin by seven points with only one race left at the World Cup finals in Lenzerheide next week. Shiffrin – the American teenage sensation who won slalom gold at the world championships in Schladming early last month and three slalom races on the World Cup circuit this year – had to settle for third place on the day. The 17-year-old from Vail, Colorado led after the first leg but was third fastest in the second to slip down the podium behind Maze and Swiss skier Wendy Holdener.
