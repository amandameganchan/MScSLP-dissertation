# ORIG CONTENT  Thousands of Tunisians have taken to the streets in protest against the Islamist-led government, exactly two years after President Ben Ali was overthrown. The demonstrators filled the capital’s central boulevard carrying banners that read “No fear, no horror, power belongs to the people” and “No to emerging dictatorships”. The moderate Islamist Ennahda party won elections in October 2011, but has struggled to restore security and stability, with many unhappy over high unemployment and prices, as well as violence linked to religious elements. Tunisia’s popular revolt inspired others across the Arab world but the man it toppled remains in exile in Saudi Arabia. The Saudi royal family has twice refused his extradition and in his absence a Tunisian court has sentenced Ben Ali to life in jail.
