# ORIG TITLE    Lebanon: ‘several hurt’ in rocket attack on Hezbollah area of Beirut . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Several people are said to have been wounded in Lebanon when two rockets hit an area of southern Beirut that is controlled by Hezbollah. It is thought the attack may have been retaliation for the pledge of support by the militant group’s leader for his Syrian ally President Bashar al-Assad. At least three people are said to have been hurt. It is not known who fired the rockets or from where. On Saturday Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah confirmed for the first time the group’s involvement in the Syria conflict. Hezbollah is a Shi’ite Muslim group; President al-Assad is from the minority Alawite sect – an offshoot of Shi’ite Islam. In a televised speech, Nasrallah claimed Sunni Muslims were being influenced by the US in order to further Israel’s interests. “I testify that the present Syrian leadership has always been prepared to sit down and negotiate, to reach a political solution and implement major reforms. But the opposition keeps refusing to have this dialogue,” he added. The fiercest fighting in Syria is in the rebel stronghold of Qusair, near the Lebanese border. Hezbollah fighters have been helping the Syrian government as it tries to seize back the strategically-important town. At least thirty of the Lebanese guerillas have been killed there according to opposition activists.
