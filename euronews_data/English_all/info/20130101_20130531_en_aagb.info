# ORIG TITLE    Indian gang rape suspects appear in court . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Five Indian men suspected of the gang-rape and murder of a 23-year old woman have appeared before a magistrate to hear charges against them. The five, along with a teenager, are accused of raping the physiotherapy student on a bus in New Delhi last month. She died two weeks later in a Singapore hospital from her injuries. The group had their faces covered when they entered the courtroom which had been closed to the public minutes earlier after shouting and angry scenes in the packed court, scenes repeated outside the hearing. “Why does this only happen to poor people” shouted many of the protesters, refering to the attack. The next hearing will be on Thursday January 10 but it remains unclear when the case will go to trial in a separate fast-track court.
