# ORIG TITLE    Credit Agricole tax hit over Greece adds to losses . 
# ORIG CONTENT  French bank Credit Agricole has posted a 6.5 billion euro full-year loss – the worst since it went public in 2001. One reason for that was the unexpected decision by French tax authorities to disallow a tax deduction Credit Agricole wanted to take following the sale of its Greek bank – Emporiki. The shock tax bill was just the latest blow for the bank which has spent the last year grappling with the legacy of ill-fated expansions into Italy, Spain and Greece. “In 2012, we turned the page and profoundly transformed the group,” Chief Executive Jean-Paul Chifflet said. “Leaving Greece cost us dearly but it was a necessary decision.” . Looking to the future, finance head Bernard Delpit said Credit Agricole, which has also been shrinking its investment division and refocusing on high street banking in France, expects to achieve a “significantly positive” result this year.
