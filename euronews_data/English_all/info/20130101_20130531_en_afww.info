The 1920s-set drama, based on a novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald, is opening the festival. Euronews correspondent Wolfgang Spindler, who is in Cannes awaiting the stars, reported: . “The red carpet’s rolled out and there’s suspense, with everyone eager to see ‘The Great Gatsby’ leads Leonardo DiCaprio and Carey Mulligan.
