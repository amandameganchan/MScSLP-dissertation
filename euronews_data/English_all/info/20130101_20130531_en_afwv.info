# ORIG TITLE    Iran faces two pronged talks over nuclear programme . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Iran is the focus of international pressure over its nuclear programme in two separate meetings. In Vienna the UN’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) began its 10th round of talks urging Tehran to cooperate with its inquiry into suspected atomic bomb research. Meanwhile a second broader diplomatic effort is also being pursued with the European Union’s top diplomat, Catherine Ashton meeting up with Iran’s chief nuclear negotiator in Istanbul. Although all parties say they are committed to dialogue analysts such as Serge Barseghian of the newspaper ‘Etemad’ are not expecting any breakthrough. “I can see no meaningful difference between this round of talks and the previous one. The upcoming presidential elections in Iran is an extra reason for both parties to take a cautious approach and wait. So it seems very unlikely that they reach an important agreement that could affect either the nuclear issue of the Iranian elections.” . While Iran insists its research is for peaceful reasons the IAEA is majorly concerned about the facilities at the Parchin military site and at the Busheher nuclear plant. Without free access the west remains suspicious and to date the UN has passed multiple rounds of sanctions against Iran related to the issue.
