# ORIG TITLE    Ligety wins Adelboden classic . 
# ORIG CONTENT  World Champion Ted Ligety claimed his fourth victory of the World Cup season on Saturday after winning the classic Adelboden giant slalom in Switzerland. The American had arch-rival and overall world cup leader Marcel Hirscher to thank for his win after the Austrian – who was leading by over a second after the first run – missed a gate on the second leg. Ligety won’t be complaining how he got the victory though and had no trouble celebrating his 15th career giant slalom triumph. The 28-year-old, who became the third most successful skier in the discipline, clocked a combined time of two minutes and 28.67 seconds. He was a massive 1.15 seconds clear of second placed German Fritz Dopfer who enjoyed his best podium placing in his five season’s on the circuit. Technical specialist Felix Neureuther made sure two Germans reached the podium. The in-form 28-year-old, who won a world cup parallel slalom event on home snow in Munich ten days ago, was nine hundredths of a second behind his team-mate. Hirscher meanwhile will be kicking himself after letting slip his first leg lead with a mistake close to the finish line. He managed to recover though and ended the race in 16th. Hirscher still tops the overall standings 26 points clear of Norway’s Aksel Lund Svindal.
