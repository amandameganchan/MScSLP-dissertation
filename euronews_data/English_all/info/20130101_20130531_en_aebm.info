# ORIG CONTENT  Large areas in and around Buenos Aires in Argentina are struggling to deal with the effects of torrential rain which has left scores dead and countless thousands homeless. In La Plata, about 60 kilometres from the capital, scores of people were electrocuted or died trapped in their cars as the water level shot up. Overnight, 400 millimetres of rain fell in just a few hours. At least 2,500 people were forced to leave their homes prompting President Cristina Fernandez to promise a bigger police presence to counter looting but there has already been some. About 20 emergency shelters sprang up in schools and other public buildings. Government estimates reckon more than 250,000 people are without power across Buenos Aires and the region. Flood waters are threatening to disrupt food supplies, and forecasters say there is more rain on the way.
