# ORIG CONTENT  The Polish capital Warsaw has commemorated the 70th anniversary of the Jewish Ghetto uprising against the Nazi occupiers during World War II. European, Polish and Israeli officials were present as a new museum was opened to remember the Jewish community that lived in Poland for centuries beforehand. The uprising against German troops followed a decision to liquidate the ghetto and kill all its residents. “We knew that the end would be the same for everyone. The thought of the uprising came from our determination. We wanted to choose the way we would die, that’s all,” Simcha Rotem, a veteran of the uprising, told the ceremony. The Israeli Education Minister who was at the ceremony recalled the diversity of the Jewish people before hundreds of thousands were incarcerated behind the Ghetto walls. Many were sent in trains bound for death camps; thousands died of starvation and disease. The uprising, which claimed 13,000 lives, saw groups of young Jews fight the Nazis with improvised weapons before it was crushed one month later.
