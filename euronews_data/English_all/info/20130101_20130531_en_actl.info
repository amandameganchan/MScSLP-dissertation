# ORIG TITLE    Non-European bias before conclave begins . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The date of the conclave that will select the next pope is still pending, as it remains unclear whether all of the 115 cardinals have arrived at the Vatican. But even before the voting procedure beings, some, such as Canadian Cardinal Marc Ouellet have said they feel like it is time for a non-European in the role. “There was a focus on Europe obviously for centuries and centuries, and I think some day it is to be expected that a Pope would come from Asia, would come from Africa, would come from America. It wouldn’t be a surprise. Nowadays it wouldn’t be a surprise”. Tuesday’s agenda involves the cardinals having meetings based on their country and geographical region. Already some have reported tensions between the Italian cardinals and those from other countries who feel they have too much influence in comparison to others.
