# ORIG CONTENT  Hungary’s prime minister told an international assembly of Jews on Sunday that his government has declared a “zero tolerance” approach to anti-Semitism. But Viktor Orban stopped short of censuring the far right Jobbik party – which his audience at the World Jewish Congress was keen for him to address. “Disappointment, anger and hate are on the rise. In this situation, it’s important to say clearly that anti-Semitism is unacceptable and cannot be tolerated;” said Orban. Congress leaders later accused the government of not drawing a clear enough line. At a Jobbick rally on Saturday, representatives accused Jews of trying to buy up property to take over Hungary. The party has 43 out of 386 seats in parliament.
