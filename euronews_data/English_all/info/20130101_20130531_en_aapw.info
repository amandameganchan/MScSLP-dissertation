# ORIG CONTENT  Lance Armstrong has spent time talking to staff at his charity foundation, amid press reports in the US that he has confessed in a TV interview to doping. The interview with Oprah Winfrey was recorded on Monday and is due to be broadcast on Thursday, although this has not yet been officially confirmed. Armstrong “did not come clean in the way I expected,” Winfrey said on Tuesday. In an appearance on a CBS TV programme, Winfrey said she would leave to others to decide if Armstrong was contrite, but added that he was serious and thoughtful in the interview. The 41-year-old has always strenuously denied using performance-enhancing drugs and never tested positive to a doping test during his career. But a report from the US anti-doping body last October cited him as being involved in an unprecedented doping scandal involving anabolic steroids, human growth hormone and blood transfusions. Armstrong’s seven Tour de France victories were nullified less than two weeks later and he was later given a lifetime ban.
