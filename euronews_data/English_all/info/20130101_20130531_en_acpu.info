# ORIG CONTENT  South Africa has suspended eight police officers after the death of a man they had bound to a vehicle and dragged through a busy street. The incident was recorded by a bystander and the video given to a local newspaper. It occurred in the Daveyton township east of Johannesburg and led to protests against police brutality. South Africa’s Minister of Police launched an investigation after the amateur footage emerged. The original police report said that the man – Mido Macia, a 27-year-old taxi driver originally from Mozambique – had been arrested for obstructing traffic and resisting arrest. He died in detention. An initial post-mortem showed he had head injuries and suffered internal bleeding.
