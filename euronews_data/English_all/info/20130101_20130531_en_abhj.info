# ORIG CONTENT  Money pledged for aid for the Syria crisis has exceeded the UN’s target, after a fundraising conference in Kuwait. One and a half billion US dollars – more than two billion euros – was the figure the UN hoped to raise, with two-thirds going to help refugees and the rest for those still in Syria. The EU will give an extra 100 million euros, with the US donating over 114 million euros. The largest contributions come from conference host country Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates – who pledged more than 221 million euros each. Kuwait’s ambassador in Brussels Nabeela Al-Mulla highlighted the importance of the gathering: “Before this conference we had only three percent of this amount. It’s true, there have been some promises, but not enough. To end this human tragedy there’s also the need for a political solution. “This amount (the UN target) . was not fixed arbitrarily but decided on after studies done on the ground by UN agencies,” she added. According to UN figures, there are now more than 700,000 Syrian refugees. More than half of these displaced people are in neighbouring Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey.
