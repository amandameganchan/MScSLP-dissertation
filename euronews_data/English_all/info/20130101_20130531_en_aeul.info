# ORIG TITLE    Boston bombing suspect remains in hospital . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The suspect in Boston’s marathon bombing lies in hospital in what the Governor of Massachusetts Deval Patrick describes as a “stable, but serious condition”. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was shot in the throat and has not yet been able to speak, according to a source close to the investigation . Meanwhile, calm has been restored to the streets of Watertown – the Boston suburb where Tsarnaev, 19, was captured on Friday night. Joy Arcolano, who lives close to where Tsarnaev was caught, said: “We felt really safe, actually, the whole time. The only time I got a little nervous was when the automatic fire happened, when they first, sort of, set their perimeter here and made themselves known to the suspect.” . Another neighbour Leah Flynn added: “I was scared because you didn’t know where this guy was. I just had an unsettling feeling that he wasn’t far, and that’s not a fun feeling.” . More than 100 hundred police officers converged on the area where they believed Tsarnaev was hiding on Friday night. Tsarnaev was eventually discovered by a homeowner who had seen blood on the boat in his backyard and found the wounded suspect hiding inside. Tsarnaev’s brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, was killed during a shootout with police on Thursday night. Not far from where the two bombs exploded on Monday, a memorial has been set up for the three people killed and 176 wounded. The suspects also shot and killed a police officer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
