# ORIG TITLE    Deadly car bomb rips through Damascus petrol station . 
# ORIG CONTENT  At least 11 people have been killed and dozens more wounded after a car bomb exploded at a petrol station in the Syrian capital Damascus, according to opposition activists. The garage was reportedly packed with people queuing for fuel – something that has become increasingly scarce during the country’s 21-month conflict. There was no immediate indication of who may be responsible for the blast, which happened in the Barzeh al-Balad district. According to one activist, there have been clashes at the petrol station between militia loyal to President Bashar al-Assad and people waiting for fuel. The United Nations says more than 60 thousand people have been killed in Syria’s civil war – a figure far higher than recent estimates by anti-regime activists.
