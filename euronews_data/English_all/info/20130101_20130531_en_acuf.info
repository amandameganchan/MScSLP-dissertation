# ORIG TITLE    Chanel at Paris Fashion Week . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A-listers including Vanessa Paradis and Jessica Chastain turned up to watch Karl Lagerfeld show his new autumn-winter collection for Channel, at Paris Fashion Week. The collection references the life of Coco Chanel, who started designing clothes in 1913. It was also a celebration of Lagerfeld’s 30 years of designing for Chanel. There were long queues for Valentino’s show at Paris Fashion Week and the front row was graced by Jessica Alba. The collection was influenced by the Flemish Masters, and Calvinism, and was apparently aimed to demonstrate the essence of contemporary grace.
