# ORIG CONTENT  Belgian authorities searching the home of a terror suspect who was shot dead after a high-speed pursuit say they found incriminating paraphernalia at his flat in Anderlecht. Prosecutors said the man was born in 1973 and came originally from Algeria. He has been named locally as Hakim Benladghem. Police moved in after intelligence from French anti-terrorist officers triggered an investigation. Prosecution spokeswoman Wenke Roggen said: “The French police suspected him of being part of a network of criminals, whose purpose is to plan terrorist acts. At his home they found weapons and ammunition and military equipment.” . Bomb disposal teams joined police in the search effort, fearful that his apartment might also have hidden an explosives cache. Neighbours were evacuated as a precaution. Among the haul investigators said they found night-vision equipment, gas masks and bullet-proof vests.
