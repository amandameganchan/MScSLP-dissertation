# ORIG TITLE    Intelligence systems failed to alert US about Boston Bombers . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A failure to share intelligence played a major role in last month’s Boston Marathon bombing. While surveillance video eventually led to the naming of two ethnic Chechen brothers as being the chief suspects behind the attack, an earlier warning from Russian security forces that one of them had possible jihadist connections was not passed on. That is the initial finding from the first in a series of Congressional hearings looking into the bombing. “My fear is that the Boston bombers may have succeeded because our system failed. We can, and we must do better,” said Michael McCaul who is chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. Boston Police Commissioner Edward Davis said: . “The truth of the matter is, nobody bats a thousand, and I think that as a nation we need to come to terms with it and do everything we can to prevent it, but also recognize that fusion centers, and intelligence analysis and joint terrorism task forces are part of our future”. Meanwhile the body of the elder brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev who died in a shoot out with police has finally been buried although where has not been disclosed. A crowd had earlier picketed outside a local funeral home where the body had been held since it was claimed from the medical examiner last week.
