# ORIG TITLE    Bad weather continues to disrupt Alpine World Cup finals . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Adverse weather conditions played havoc with the alpine skiing World Cup finals in Lenzerheide for the second day running. After day one’s downhill events were cancelled due to thick fog driving wind and snow hit the Swiss resort affecting the men’s and women’s super-G. Despite the weather the men’s race did start but was soon stopped after Austrian Klaus Kroell, the 10th racer and last year’s downhill World Cup champion, crashed heavily into the safety nets and was later flown to hospital with a broken shoulder. The cancellation of the final super-G of the season meant Aksel Lund Svindal of Norway celebrated winning the discipline title, adding that to the downhill crystal globe he won on Wedesday. Overall World Cup champion Tina Maze of Slovenia added the women’s super-G title to her combined and giant slalom crowns already in the bag.
