# ORIG TITLE    Seven die in attack on Kenyan tourist resort . 
# ORIG CONTENT  At least seven people, including a police officer, have died, after a casino popular with tourists was attacked in Malindi on Kenyaâ€™s Indian Ocean coast. Six of the dead were members of the group that raked the casino with gunfire and attempted to attack people with machetes. Authorities say about 100 members of the separatist Council for the Mombasa Republic took part in the assault, but were driven off by the four police officers on duty in the tourist complex. Four arrests were made. The separatist group has been accused of the attacks ahead of the elections at the start of this month that left 12 people dead. It claims that the mainly Muslim region has been neglected by the government in Nairobi.
