# ORIG CONTENT  Iranian voters have been treated to their first-ever televised electoral debate between the presidential hopefuls. The eight leaders in the running took part in a question and answer session during which all aspects of Iranian society were touched on. The favourite at this stage is Saad Jalili, currently steering Iran through international nuclear negiotiations. The debate also gave reformers a rare opportunity to get their messages across. “The most important thing in economics is to avoid authoritarism and individualism,” observed Hassan Rohani during the debate. There will be notable absentees, like former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, or the current president’s protegée, Esfandiar Mashaei. Ahead of the June 14th poll the Americans announced they would be partially lifting their economic and financial embargo of Iran to allow people access to “software, services and equipment for personal communication,” perhaps mindful of the “people power” that brought thousands into the streets after the last election.
