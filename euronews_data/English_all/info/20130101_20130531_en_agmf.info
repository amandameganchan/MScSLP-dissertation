# ORIG CONTENT  The marriage of Vincent Aubin and Bruno Boileau, set to go ahead in Montpellier on Wednesday evening, will be the first gay marriage in France, since the law was passed on April 23 legalising same sex-marriage and adoption by gay couples. The couple know their big day will under the media microscope. “ This not about Vincent and Bruno this is about equality under the law, this for all the people who have fought for the right to say ‘I do’,” said Vincent. Bruno is keen to have a family: “We hope to have a family in time. That is certain. It is something we both wanted, even before we met. This law also allows adoption, it will come.” . Security will be tight around Montpellier Town Hall as those opposed to the bill plan to demonstrate. The new law has caused outrage in certain sections of French society. Last Sunday 150,000 people took to the streets of Paris to protest against the law. What started as a peaceful march ended in violence with police making a total of 293 arrests. France is the 14th country in the world to legalise gay marriage.
