# ORIG TITLE    Rugby captains attend Six Nations launch . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Team captain’s Pascal Pape of France, England’s Chris Robshaw, Wales’ Sam Warburton, Ireland’s Jamie Heaslip, Italy’s Sergio Parisse and Scotland’s Kelly Brown all posed with the trophy during the Six Nations launch at The Hurlingham Club in London on Wednesday. This year’s tournament has the added bonus of being directly before a British and Irish Lions tour of Australia, so players will be looking to impress for a place in the squad. Brown’s men will be seeking to end England’s thirty-year unbeaten home record against the Scots when both sides meet in the opening game. The tournament kicks off on February 2.
