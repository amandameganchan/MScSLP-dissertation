# ORIG TITLE    Tempers flare in Kiev council election row . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A fight broke out inside the Kiev City Council building when Ukrainian opposition MPs tried to enter the chamber to demand fresh local elections. A date for a new poll should have been set for this May, but the current council appears intent on over running its mandate. City Council member Halyna Hereha was determined to ignore the disruption. “We are not letting anyone go on holiday. The City Council will carry on working as before, we are preparing an agenda for the next plenary session, and all departments will keep working as usual.” . The last elected mayor resigned over a year ago. “Parliament has not called an election, even though it’s obliged to do so by the constitution. The election date should have been set as five years have passed since the last poll,” said political analyst Ihor Koliushko. Kiev city council is normally a government opposition stronghold and attempts to call fresh elections have been repeatedly blocked by the pro-government majority in the national parliament.
