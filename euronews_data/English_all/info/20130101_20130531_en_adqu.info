# ORIG CONTENT  Eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem is under fire from fellow EU officials over comments he made over the Cyprus bailout deal. The Dutch Finance minister, in the job for just two months, is already facing criticism for his handling of the Cypriot case. He gave an interview on Monday describing Nicosia’s bailout as a ‘model’ before U-turning hours later. A European Commission spokeswoman suggested Cyprus was a specific case, saying “That doesn’t mean that it is a perfect model that should be re-used in the future.” . Depositors with sums greater than 100,000 euros could see 40 percent of their savings converted into shares of two sick Cypriot banks.
