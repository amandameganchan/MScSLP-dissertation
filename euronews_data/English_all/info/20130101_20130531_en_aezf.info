# ORIG TITLE    Mother of Boston bomb suspects berates US authorities . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The parents of the Boston suspects have denied that their sons planted the bombs, believing they were framed. Appearing together in the Russian region of Dagestan, their father Anzor Tsarnaev said he planned to travel to America this week, while their mother attacked the US authorities. “They told us that they’re never gonna show us Dzhokhar, even if we go there, until he will be in their jail, we won’t be able to see him,” Zubeidat Tsarnaeva said, referring to her wounded younger son who is still in hospital and has been charged over the bombings. “They are already saying that we are terrorists. They already want me, him (indicating her ex-husband), and all of us to look as terrorists,” she added. Media reports the mother faces an outstanding shoplifting charge in Boston from last year and could face arrest if she returns. She told reporters she regretted the family had ever moved to the US. “I thought America was going to protect us, our kids, was going to be safe… But it happened opposite. America took my kids away from me,” she said in English, breaking down in tears. American congressmen have said they do not believe the brothers had contact with a militant organisation. But in Moscow, President Putin used a nationwide TV phone-in to argue the Boston bombing justified Russia’s tough line on insurgents in the North Caucasus. He said Moscow and Washington should step up cooperation on security: “Russia is a victim of international terrorism, one of the first victims. This tragedy should bring us closer together, in stopping the threats we have in common, the most dangerous being terrorism,” said the Russian leader. Putin, who crushed a Chechen bid for independence over a decade ago, has long accused the US of underestimating the Islamist threat.
