# ORIG TITLE    Oscar Pistorius granted bail by South African court . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Oscar Pistorius was granted bail by a South African court on Friday after his lawyers successfully argued he was not a flight risk. The man known worldwide as the ‘Blade Runner’ is charged with the murder of his girlfriend. He was often seen weeping in court this week. But the bail decision elicited little emotion. Outside the court, it was a different story as the athlete’s family and supporters cheered. Bail was set at around 85,000 euros. Reeva Steenkamp was shot dead at the home of Pistorius in the early hours of Valentine’s Day whenhe fired four times through a bathroom door. Prosecutors maintain the 29-year old model and girlfriend of Pistorius was a victim of premeditated murder. His defence is that he mistook her for an intruder. Steenkamp sustained gunshot wounds to the head, hip and arm. Pistorius was removed from the scene by police to face South Africa’s justice system. Details from both prosecution and defence have emerged in court throughout the week. The athlete’s fame was a factor in the decision to grant bail after his defence team argued that he was too distinctive to go anywhere unnoticed. Pistorius faces life in prison if convicted of premeditated murder.
