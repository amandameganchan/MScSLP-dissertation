# ORIG CONTENT  Protests have taken place in the city of Karachi in Pakistan, the day after a senior politician from the country’s third largest party was killed in a drive-by shooting. It is not clear who was behind the death of Zara Shahid Hussein. PTI party leader Imran Khan has blamed the MQM party, a powerful force in the city. But MQM’s leaders have denied responsibility and demanded a retraction. “We demand justice. We voted for a new Pakistan, we want change but they just changed our vote,” said one woman in the crowd of protesters. “That’s not going to work with us, we’re going to come out every night if we have to. We want to feel safe in our homes, own homes. We don’t want to feel unsafe and terror and not be able to come out. This is our country,” she continued. Last week’s election handed a landslide victory to the Pakistan Muslim League of Nawaz Sharif. But results from a handful of constituencies remain uncertain amid accusations of vote-rigging. Re-voting is underway in others where security issues hampered voting.
