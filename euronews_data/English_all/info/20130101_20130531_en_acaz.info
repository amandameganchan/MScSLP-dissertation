# ORIG TITLE    Correa expected to be re-elected president of Ecuador . 
# ORIG CONTENT  With polls showing a lead of more than 35 percent, Rafael Correa is likely to win Sunday’s presidential election in Ecuador. It will be a third win for the only president of Ecuador to finish a full term in 20 years. The closest opponent with around 15 percent is former banker Guillermo Lasso. The conservative candidate promised to unveil a new policy everyday during the 45-day campaign. Since being overthrown as president in 2005, Lucio Gutierrez has been trying to make a comeback. The ex-military man lost to Correa in 2009 and is polling between one and five percent this time. Seven opposition candidates are running against Correa, who has been president since 2006. The left-winger has styled himself as a man of the people. He favours big government and improving the country infrastructure – paid for by oil exports. Correa has brought stability to Ecuador. However, critics accuse him of being authoritarian and intent on amassing power. Another win would allow Correa to remain as president until 2017.
