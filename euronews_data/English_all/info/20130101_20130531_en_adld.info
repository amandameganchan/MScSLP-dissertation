# ORIG TITLE    Tough talking over Cyprus as Russia smells opportunity . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Russian Prime Minster Dmitry Medvedev has called for all interested parties to be involved in a deal for Cyprus. He was speaking as EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso visited Moscow. That is diplomatic speak, Marat Terterov, a geopolitical analyst, explained to euronews journalist Andrei Beketov what is really going on behind closed doors. “I think there is more basis for competition really than cooperation. And that’s simply based on the fact that both Brussels and Moscow have significant interests in Cyprus. However, I think that any Russian financial assistance and investments of a direct nature, will be very prudent from Moscow and it will be very much on hard-nosed commercial terms” . Euronews: “Russia obviously needs an outpost in the Mediterranean. Do you think Moscow will abandon Syria in favour of the more useful Cyprus as an ally?” . Marat Terterov, European Geopolitical Forum director: . “I don’t think Russia will try to put all its eggs in one basket, neither Syria or Cyprus. It would prefer to have its cake and eat it too.” . Speculation is rife that Cyprus may offer Russia access to untapped gas reserves in return for Russian aid, something Europe would be keen to avoid.
