Li Yanting of the Shangai Municipal Center for Disease said: . “Food has to be cleaned and thoroughly cooked. People should not eat half-cooked food. Some people like to eat half-cooked boiled chicken even with fresh blood on it. It’s very dangerous.” . The four new victims – in the eastern Jiangsu province next to Shanghai – are said to be between 32 and 83-years-old but only one, a woman of 45 had worked closely with the birds. Experts say the strain appears not to be highly contagious so there is no major cause for alarm.
