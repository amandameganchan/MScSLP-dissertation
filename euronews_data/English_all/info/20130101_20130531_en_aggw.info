# ORIG CONTENT  Two suicide bombers have struck Northern Niger, injuring at least 16 people. A subsequent gunbattle with suspected Islamist militants has claimed the lives of up to 10 soldiers. The original attacks occurred at an army base in Agadez and a plant run by French nuclear group Areva in Arlit. Following the bombing at the military barracks other terrorists arrived in cars and clashed with soliders, according to Reuters’ sources. A Western diplomat said around 10 people had been killed. A source at the Areva plant said no employees had been killed, but reported 13 people were wounded in the blast. The French nuclear reactor condemned the bombings, calling them a “despicable attack” and said it was working with local and French forces.
