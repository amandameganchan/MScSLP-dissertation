# ORIG CONTENT  Champagne corks popped in Glasgow as hundreds gathered to celebrate the death of Margaret Thatcher. Similar outbursts of joy broke out in Liverpool, Brixton in London and parts of Wales. In Northern Ireland the Nationalist community detested her uncompromising nature and during her tenure support for Republicanism increased: . Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams was at the heart of the Republican confrontation with the British establishment: . “Margaret Thatcher, in her terms as British Prime Minister, did great hurt to people in Britain, to working class communities across Britain, but also to people here in Ireland. And I suppose most Republicans and Nationalists will remember her for for the shameful role she played during the epic hunger strikes in 1980 and 1981.” . The Maze or Long Kesh hunger strikes left ten people dead as Thatcher stubbornly refused to restore their status as political prisoners. Public sympathy for the strikers grew and resulted in Bobby Sands, one of the strikers, being elected to the House of Commons before his death. Under Thatcher the IRA stepped up its campaign of violence and Sinn Fein grew as a potent political force.
