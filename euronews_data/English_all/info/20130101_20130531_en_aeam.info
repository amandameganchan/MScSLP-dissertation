# ORIG CONTENT  A second US destroyer has been sent to the Western Pacific amid rising tensions between North and South Korea. The Pentagon’s decision reveals a move by the US to firm up their military capability in the region, in a bid to reassure allies in Seoul and Tokyo. Secretary of State John Kerry hosted his South Korean counterpart in Washington and outlined the US stance. “What Kim Jong Un has been choosing to do is provocative, it is dangerous, reckless, and the United States will not accept the DPRK as a nuclear state,” he said at a press conference at the State Department. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has declared the region on the brink of war, prompting UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to appeal for discussion and negotiation, saying that the crisis had already gone too far. But Pyongyang has announced plans to restart its main Yongbyon nuclear complex, a move that would breach its international obligations.
