# ORIG CONTENT  There is widespread anger in Argentina over the authorities response to deadly flash flooding. Local government officials were greeted with insults as they arrived in La Plata,the capital of Buenos Aires province, one of the areas most heavily affected. A torrential downpour dumped more than a month’s worth of rain in just one day, leaving 51 people dead. As the governor of Buenos Aires province arrived one woman yelled that officials had turned up too late and empty handed. “Everyone’s been evacuated and we’ve lost everything,” she said. Many people, who were forced to flee their homes at the height of the storm, returned to their dwellings to assess flood damage and salvage anything they could lay their hands on. Police have been struggling amid reports of widespread looting. Some have managed to make it to temporary shelters to receive assistance and medical supplies. But search and rescue operations have been greatly hampered by the conditions and it is clear emergency services are struggling to cope in the wake of the disaster.
