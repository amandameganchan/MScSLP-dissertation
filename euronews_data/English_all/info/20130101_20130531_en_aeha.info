# ORIG CONTENT  Teachers in Denmark, where schools have been closed for a week, have formed a 35-kilometre human chain in protest. Nine hundred thousand kids have been affected, after local authorities shut the schools when negotiations with teachers over working conditions broke down. The Danish Teachersâ€™ Union say 6,000 teachers formed the chain between the capital Copenhagen and the city of Roskilde.
