# ORIG CONTENT  Months of political uncertainty in Bulgaria could come to an end on Wednesday when parliament votes on a Socialist-led but partially technocratic government. Plamen Oresharksi, the candidate for leader is already being likened to Italy’s former premier Mario Monti because of his reputation for fiscal discipline. And much like Monti he is promising to bring stability, economic growth and a normal business environment to Bulgaria. A commitment that has been endorsed by President Rosen Plevneliev: “I know that no politician finds it easy to work here with public trust so low and that’s why I respect his decision to bear the responsibility of becoming prime minister at such a difficult period for the nation,” he said. Protests which began in winter over high fuel prices grew into massive demonstrations over low wages and Bulgaria’s economy. There was also widespread anger against politicians seen as corrupt and inept.
