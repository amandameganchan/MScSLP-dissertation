# ORIG TITLE    South African police brutality caught on camera . 
# ORIG CONTENT  There has been shock in South Africa at amateur footage shows a man being tied to the back of a police van and dragged down the street. It is claimed that the man seen in the video later died in police custody. Police report that Mido Macia, a 27-year-old taxi driver from Mozambique, had been arrested for obstructing traffic and resisting arrest. The footage taken by a bystander in the Daveyton township east of Johannesburg, appeared on the website of the South African Daily Sun newspaper. It has prompted an independent investigation into the images. Moses Dlamini, from the Independent Police Investigative Directorate, said that the official police report differs from what the footage shows. “They just say this man was assaulting a police officer, they arrested him, put him in the police van and took him to the station.” . Amnesty International has said that there is an “increasingly disturbing pattern” of police brutality in South Africa. This latest incident has done nothing to improve the image of the South African police who shot dead 34 striking miners last summer.
