# ORIG CONTENT  Venezuela’s vice president says ailing President Hugo Chavez is fighting for his life in a Caracas hospital. Nicolas Maduro, named by Chavez as his chosen successor, has admitted the severity of the Socialist leader’s condition. “Our Commander is sick because he gave his life for those who don’t have anything and never had anything. He’s battling for his life and for his health. And we are there with him,” he said. Chavez, believed to be suffering from cancer in his pelvic area, was re-elected in October for another six year term. His inauguration, scheduled for January 10, was delayed because of a trip to Cuba for surgery. Many believe he may now be sworn in from hospital in Caracas.
