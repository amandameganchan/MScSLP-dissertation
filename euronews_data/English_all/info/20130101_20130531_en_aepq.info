# ORIG TITLE    Boston explosions: world reaction . 
# ORIG CONTENT  From governments across the world to individuals, reaction to the Boston explosions has been swift and condemnatory. In Japan, where people are passionate about running marathons, there has been an immediate step up in security as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe explained. “Japan’s police departments are increasing security and monitoring important facilities as well as areas where large numbers of people are gathering. We are doing everything possible to ensure the safety of our citizens. “ . In Australia, as in other countries, frantic efforts are underway to check if any of their nationals were caught in the explosions. “All our sympathies are with the people of the United States, with their government as they respond to what could well be terrorist strikes. Certainly the fact that these explosions have been associated with the marathon suggests it has been an attack by terrorists, though we await confirmation of that,” Bob Carr the Australian Foreign Minister told reporters. US embassies have stepped up security and as London prepares for its annual marathon on Sunday Sports Minister Hugh Robertson said he was “absolutely confident” it could be kept safe.
