# ORIG TITLE    Sir Alex to retire at end of season . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Sir Alex Ferguson announced on Wednesday he will step down at the end of this season ending one of the most successful managerial careers in professional football. In the 27-years the 71-year-old has been in charge, United have remained consistently at the top end of the premier league, and won the title an impressive 13 times. The Scotsman’s strength is his eye for spotting gifted players and then moulding them with a team-first philosophy to create a match winning side. This knack has meant many of the sport’s biggest names such as, Keane, Beckham, Ronaldo and Rooney have all cut their teeth with Man U. While Ryan Giggs at 39-years-old has never played for any other manager. Fergie has also beaten the best from the rest of Europe winning the Champion’s League in 1999 and 2008 and domestically he has won the FA cup five times and the League Cup four times . His decision to quit now, though not entirely unexpected, comes as a huge disappointment for the club, and it’s clear that he’ll be sorely missed as former Manchester United player, Clayton Blackmore explains. “What he’s done for the club over that many years is incredible, it’ll never happen again, it’s never happened before. “It’s a sad day for me and I’m sure it’ll be the same for all the players and all the supporters, the good news is he’s staying at the club.” . While Sir Alex Ferguson will stay on as a board member with the Red Devils, many have speculated that professional football may never see such a successful manager ever again.
