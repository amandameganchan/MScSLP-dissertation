# ORIG TITLE    Floral tributes at Thatcher’s house . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Not all reactions to Baroness Thatcher’s death have been positive. Her economic and industrial policies of the 80s left deep scars that still exist today. But there was also a steady stream of flowers and tributes at the doorstep of Thatcher’s house in London. Student Ned Donovan is 19 and a big Thatcher fan. “I never had the chance to meet Lady Thatcher, but although I wasn’t old enough to remember her premiership – or was even born – I felt this was my way of remembering her, and thanking her for the way she kept Britain and (for) the way it is today. (She) ensured that we still are a great nation that we can be proud of.” . Her impact was international. A visitor from New Jersey in the United States who gave his name simply as Mike said: “We love her over there. We always thought of her as equal to Ronald Reagan, that great a politician. We love her over there and we are all going to miss her. I used to see her come out (of her house: ed) a couple of years back. She’s been in hospital a long time now but I used to come out and wave to her as we were walking the dog. A very lovely woman.” . The small patch of pavement in front of the house gives the British a chance to have their say.
