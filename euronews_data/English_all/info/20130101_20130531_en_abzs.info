# ORIG TITLE    Pistorius to contest murder charge ‘in strongest terms’ . 
# ORIG CONTENT  An agent for Oscar Pistorius says the athlete disputes the accusation of murder against him “in the strongest possible terms”. The world famous amputee known as “Blade Runner” appeared in court in Pretoria and broke down in tears as the charges were read out. Prosecutors said they intended to argue that the international sports star had committed premeditated murder. Pistorius is alleged to have shot dead his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp at his home in the early hours of Thursday morning. Early reports suggested Pistorius may have mistaken her for an intruder, but police said neighbours had heard noises before the shots and that they had been called to previous domestic incidents at the house. Reports in South Africa said Steenkamp was shot through a bathroom door and had been hit four times. A pistol was recovered from the scene. The 29-year-old model had reportedly been due to give a talk on violence against women at a Johannesburg school this week. Pistorius will remain in custody before the next hearing on Tuesday.
