# ORIG TITLE    Rain doesn’t ruin red carpet at first weekend of Cannes . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Regulars claim rain at Cannes used be rare, but the continual downpours are not stopping the stars from gracing the red carpet. Making an appearance on Saturday night was Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence, who is actually in France promoting Catching Fire, the second Hunger Games film. Old-school Hollywood glamour came from Jane Fonda and Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich was the heavy-metal heavy-weight. euronews correspondent at Cannes Fred Ponsard Cannes described the mood on a night with two very different movies. “Festival-goers are getting the feel of a competition that promises to take them to a lot of different places,” Ponsard said. “In tonight’s entries, we swing from a western set in 1950s Kansas – ‘Jimmy P’ by Arnaud Desplechin – to modern-day Tokyo, in a dramatic comedy ‘Like Father, Like Son’ by Hirokazu Kore-eda,” he added. ‘Jimmy P (Psychotherapy Of A Plains Indian)’ stars Benicio Del Toro, Gina McKee and Mathieu Amalric. The movie is based on the true story of a friendship between a Native American war veteran and a French psychoanalyst. It is the first US feature film by French director Arnaud Desplechin and is up for Cannes’ top Palme d’Or prize. Fellow Palme d’Or contender, ‘Like Father, Like Son’ is about two families who discover their six-year-old boys were switched at birth. The hospital suggests both families get to know the other boy over the course of a year and eventually exchange them.
