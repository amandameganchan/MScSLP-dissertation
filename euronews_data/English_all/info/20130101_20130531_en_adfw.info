# ORIG TITLE    International Space Station crew land safely in Kazakhstan . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Three International Space Station (ISS) . crew have returned to earth safely. The Russian Soyuz capsule carrying them landed in the Kazakhstan steppes a day later than planned due to poor weather conditions. The Russo-American trio Kevin Ford, Oleg Novitskiy and Evgeny Tarelkin had spent 144 days aboard the space station and clocked up 61 million miles in space. The crewâ€™s descent took just under four hours. NASA reported that the deorbit burn had gone flawlessly, with the capsule landing upright almost hitting the bulls-eye landing spot through thick fog. The crew are said to be doing well and will be transported to a post-flight rehabilitation centre. They leave aboard another three-man crew. Canadian Chris Hadfield took the helm on Wednesday ahead of their departure. It marks the first time a non-American or non-Russian commands the outpost. Russia remains the only country capable of getting astronauts to and from the ISS since the Americans retired their space shuttles in 2011.
