# ORIG CONTENT  Two devices have exploded outside Turkeyâ€™s foreign ministry and the head office of the ruling AK Party in the capital Ankara. At least two people have been wounded according to Turkish media reports. A grenade was used in the attack on the Justice ministry, while the AKP offices were targeted with a rocket launcher. Police have arrested two people, but for the moment no-one has claimed responsibility for the attack. One source speculated the attacks may have been to derail peace negotiations currently underway between the government and the Kurds. On Thursday their jailed leader Abdullah Ocalan is expected to announce a unilateral ceasefire to mark the Kurdish New Year.
