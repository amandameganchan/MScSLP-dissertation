Despite announcing his resignation on March 24, the coalition’s head Moaz Alkhatib attended the embassy opening. He voiced his frustration with world powers for failing to do more to help overthrow Assad’s regime: . “There’s some international will to stop this revolution being victorious. I say that the people who have challenged that injustice, and the tyrant, will continue and won’t stop, whatever the international decisions are,” Alkhatib told reporters. Euronews correspondent Maha Barada reported from Doha: “An embassy for the Syrian opposition coalition and a seat for them at the summit. Both of these are steps towards reinforcing their position as the legitimate representative of the Syrian people.” .
