# ORIG TITLE    EU fishing reform aims to tackle dwindling stocks . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The EU has agreed to overhaul its fishing policy in a move designed to rebuild dwindling stocks by 2020. The plan seeks to put an end to decades of overfishing, boosting EU fish stocks by 15 million tonnes by the end of the decade. The industry should pay greater attention scientific advice on quotas and protect sensitive areas at sea. The reform also wants to reduce the wasteful and much-criticised practice of discarding. That is when fishermen throw unwanted fish back into the sea to keep to strict quotas. The plan still needs to be approved by EU member states and MEPs.
