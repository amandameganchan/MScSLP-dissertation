# ORIG CONTENT  Pakistani cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan is recovering in hospital after falling off a makeshift lift in Lahore. He was being raised onto a stage at a rally, just days before the country’s parliamentary elections. The PTI party leader suffered two minor skull fractures and a back injury. But Khan was soon talking politics again, when he addressed voters from his hospital bed. “I have fought for Pakistan all my life, I have done whatever I could do,” he said. “Now I want you to take responsibility. If you want to change your fate then you have to take responsibility.” . Dozens of supporters have been praying for Khan’s recovery. His party is not expected to win Saturday’s poll, but it could be a major partner in a coalition government.
