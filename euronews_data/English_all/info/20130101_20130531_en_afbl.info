# ORIG TITLE    Piece of 9/11 plane found in New York . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A piece of landing gear that is believed to come from one of the planes that struck the twin towers during the 9/11 attacks in 2001 has been found wedged between two buildings in lower Manhattan. It was found wedged, one story high, by a construction crew in a narrow alleyway behind 51 Park Place and 50 Murray Street in Manhattan’s financial district. This site is now home to an Islamic prayer space and community centre that opened amid controversy in the autumn of 2011, two blocks from Ground Zero. New York City Police spokesman Paul Browne said there is a “clearly visible” Boeing identification number on the gear. Almost 12 years after the World Trade Centre was brought down by Islamic extremists killing nearly 3,000 people, debris from the attack and human remains are still turning up.
