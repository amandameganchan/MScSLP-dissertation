# ORIG TITLE    Swatch gets hitched to Harry Winston . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Not many jewellers get namechecked in a hit song, but Harry Winston is one of them. His diamonds were Marilyn Monroeâ€™s Best Friend; now they have seduced Swiss watchmaker Swatch, which has bought the watches and high-end jewellery division from the Canadian miner for 561 million euros. Swatch Group is already the world number one watchmaker by sales, and the purchase allows it to take on giants like Cartier in the jewellery stakes.
