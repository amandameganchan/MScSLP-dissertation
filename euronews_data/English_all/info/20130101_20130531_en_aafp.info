# ORIG TITLE    Europeâ€™s highest football pitch . 
# ORIG CONTENT  At approximately 2 kilometres above sea level, the Ottmar Hitzfeld pitch in Switzerland ranks as the highest in Europe. The stadium itself, which resembles a five a side venue more than an 11-a-side pitch, serves as the home of FC Gspon and has also hosted the European Mountain Village championships. It is so high that the playing surface is artificial and the only way up is by cable car. Gspon itself is little more than a cluster of ski and summer holiday chalets. Mustering a team of fit players is a struggle so the team is largely one imported from Staldenried, at the other end of the cable car a few hundred metres below.
