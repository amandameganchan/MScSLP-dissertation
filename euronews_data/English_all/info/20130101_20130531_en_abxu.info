# ORIG CONTENT  Greece’s jobless rate has hit a new record of 27 percent as the austerity-fuelled recession there continues to take its toll on the labour market. That was in November – the latest figures available from the country’s statistics service ELSTAT. The situation for Greece’s young people is even grimmer. Almost 62 percent of those aged 15 to 24 are out of work . Greek unemployment was more than double the eurozone’s average rate of 11.7 percent in November. Athens projects the country’s economy will contract by 4.5 percent this year. The jobs situation is boosting the popularity of parties that oppose the country’s bailout deals.
