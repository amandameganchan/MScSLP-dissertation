# ORIG CONTENT  The European Union has fined Microsoft 561 million euros. The EU’s competition regulators said that was because it had broken a promise to offer all European consumers a choice of web browsers in its operating system rather than automatically defaulting to Microsoft’s Internet Explorer. The US software maker blamed a technical error for the problem. The fine will act as a warning to other technology firms – such as Google – that are involved in competition disputes with the EU.
