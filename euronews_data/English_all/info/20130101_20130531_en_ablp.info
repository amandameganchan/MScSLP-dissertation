# ORIG CONTENT  Iran has given euronews its response to a US offer of direct talks to resolve the stalemate over Tehran’s nuclear programme. The US vice president Joe Biden, speaking at this year’s Munich Security Conference, reiterated previous indications that the US was prepared to talk on-on-one with Iran. The west fears Tehran is developing nuclear weapons. Iran maintains the programme is purely for peaceful means. Both sides said any direct talks would need good faith. Iran’s foreign minister at the conference Ali Akbar Salehi told euronews: “This negotiation can only take place when we get enough assurances that, this time, the US comes forward with honest intentions. Because our previous experiences unfortunately have shown the opposite.” . Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said he would give Biden strong support, but also talked about the need to show Iran incentives.
