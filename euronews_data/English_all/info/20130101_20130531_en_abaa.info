# ORIG TITLE    Record tumbles in climb to the top of Argentine mountain . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Carlos Sa marathon runner and climber has entered the record books after his conquest of the highest peak in the Americas. The Portuguese knocked nearly five hours off the record for the ascent of Aconcagua cutting the time from 20 hours to 15 hours and 42 minutes. The mountain, in the Andes range in Argentina rises to almost 7,000 meters and this was Sa’s second attempt at the record. Technically in mountaineering terms it is known as an easy climb, but it has what is called, “a hidden evil” the intense cold which has caused many injures to climbers in the past and Sa also had to cope with deep snow hampering his progress to the top and that record.
