# ORIG TITLE    Death in Cairo after politicians renounce violence . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A day after Egypt’s rival political groups renounced violence a man was shot dead in continuing clashes in Cairo. Protesters demanding the overthrow of Mohamed Mursi set about the presidential palace with petrol bombs and fireworks. They were met with water-cannon, tear-gas and deadly small arms fire. The second anniversary of Hosni Mubarak’s overthrow has erupted into the bloodiest week of his successor’s seven months in power. Almost 60 people have died across the country. Mursi’s opponents have posted pictures of the violence online with comments saying: “It’s as if the revolution never happened.” . Many protesters feel he has betrayed the spirit of the revolution by hijacking power and influence for himself and the Muslim Brotherhood at the expense of non-Islamist and secular groups. The growing chasms between differing parts of Egyptian society has made the country virtually ungovernable.
