# ORIG TITLE    Springsteen and the E Street Band on the road in Europe . 
# ORIG CONTENT  ‘The Boss’ is back as Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band kick off another European Tour with two shows in Oslo: . Springsteen’s midas touch shows no sign of waning, his music and lyrics still have the capacity to move his legions of fans. He explained the craft behind his lyrics: “As an artist you’re paid to use your imagination and develop a vocabulary and a craft that allows you to step into other people’s shoes and walk in those shoes, and give your audience a sense of what it’s like to walk in those shoes. All great filmmakers do the same thing. Nobody expects Martin Scorsese to be an actual member of the mafia, but he imagines it quite well. So it’s not a trick, it’s not a magic trick.” . Springsteen is a modern day Charles Dickens or George Orwell, a chronicler of the struggles faced by the American working class: “The huge problem in America right now is just the huge inequality, the wealth that has been increasing over the last 30 years, blah blah, I won’t go into it with you, but that is something that still motivates me and moves me to write about,” he said. The Boss and the E Street Band are on tour in Europe until the end of July.
