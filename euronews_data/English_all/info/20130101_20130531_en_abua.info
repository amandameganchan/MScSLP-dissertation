# ORIG TITLE    Russian opposition activist under house arrest . 
# ORIG CONTENT  For the first time Russia has placed an opposition activist under house arrest. Sergei Udaltsov is charged with organising “mass disorder” ahead of President Vladimir Putin’s inauguration last May. He is subject to an investigation expected to conclude in April. The court in Basmanny claimed they came to the decision to place him under house arrest as he was not cooperating with them. Udaltsov is no stranger to controversy. He has been repeatedly detained during protests. His supporters say the authorities wish to hamper the opposition movement. On Thursday another opposition activist was arrested over the May protests, bringing the number of people awaiting trial to 12.
