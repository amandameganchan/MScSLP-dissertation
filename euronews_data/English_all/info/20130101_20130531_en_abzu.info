# ORIG TITLE    Flying glass hazard in central Russia meteor shower . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Nearly 1,000 people injured as a meteor shower rained down on central Russia were mainly hurt by flying glass.   No one was killed in the celestial event in Chelyabinsk, but the country’s Emergencies Ministry says nearly 1,000 have been hurt - including children.   Speaking from Chelyabinsk Hospital, surgeon Vladimir Basmannikov said: “The wounds that people have are mainly cuts and bruises, due to windows and window frames breaking and flying around. And you can see how many people are here. We’ve already treated 60 or 70, and we still have a corridor full of people.”   The meteor explosion and shower may be connected to an asteroid the size of an Olympic swimming pool that is due to pass Earth at a distance of 27,520 kilometres – however, the link has not been confirmed.   It is thought another meteorite hit Siberia in 1908 devastating an area of more than 2,000 square kilometres.
