And following abnormal blood values from her biological passport is now facing an automatic lifetime ban. Another Turkish athlete, double European 100m hurdles champion Nevin Yanit, also faces a ban after multiple positive findings in both in-competition and out-of-competiton tests.

Their cases have been referred to the Turkish federation for adjudication.
