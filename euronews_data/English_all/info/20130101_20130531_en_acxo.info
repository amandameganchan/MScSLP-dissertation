# ORIG CONTENT  There have been mixed reactions in South Korea, after the UN’s decided to step up sanctions against Pyongyang and the North’s reaction to end all non-aggression pacts with Seoul. Kim Woo-Hyok, a 24-year-old South Korean, said: “(North Korea) has been provocative every time there have been UN resolutions and sanctions. So I don’t think the new resolution will change the North. I’m more worried about the its declaration to end the armistice.” . Meanwhile peace protester, You Young-Jae, said he thinks the resolutions are a mistake: . “The UN resolutions against North Korea will make the situation worse, not facilitate peace on the peninsula, so we are decisively against the resolution.” . As well as ending its non-aggression pacts, North Korea has closed its hotline with the South and shut their shared border point.
