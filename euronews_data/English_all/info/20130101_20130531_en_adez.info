# ORIG TITLE    More data supports Higgs boson discovery . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Physicists at the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland have backed up last summer’s announcement of the discovery of a new particle declaring there is now little doubt it is the long-sought after Higgs boson. More data analysis has supported the search for the Higgs, said to be a vital component in explaining the origins of the universe in the Big Bang 13.7 billion years ago. Physicists believe the boson and its linked energy field were vital in the formation of the universe after by bringing flying particles together to make stars, planets and eventually humans – giving mass to matter, to use the scientific jargon. The particle and the field, named for British physicist Peter Higgs who predicted their existence 50 years ago, are also the last major missing elements in what scientists call the Standard Model of how the cosmos works at the very basic level. But the CERN statement stopped short of claiming a discovery, which would clear the way to Nobel prizes for scientists linked to the project. Instead it floated the idea that this might be an exotic “super-Higgs” offering a key to new worlds of physics.
