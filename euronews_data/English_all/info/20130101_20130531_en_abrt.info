# ORIG CONTENT  President of the world anti-doping agency John Fahey was “alarmed but not surprised” at Thursday’s shocking government report which revealed “widespread” doping among professional and amateur athletes across several sports codes in Australia. Fahey – a former state premier of New South Wales – blamed organised crime for the scandal. He said: “The providers and suppliers of the illegal drugs, the performance enhancing drugs and even those involved in match fixing, that underworld is one and the same. They are connected to all three. I guess I was naive enough to think, ah yes, that’s Asia, that’s Europe, today now I know it’s Australia. The report – which has sent shockwaves through the country – was the result of a year-long investigation by Australia’s top criminal intelligence unit. The report has prompted several governing bodies to launch their own probes into their sports.
