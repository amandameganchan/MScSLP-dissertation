# ORIG CONTENT  America was not given any advance warning of Israeli air strikes in Syria, according to a US intelligence official. Israeli jets bombed Syria on Sunday for the second time in 48 hours. Strikes have targeted weapons headed for Hezbollah militants, according to Western and Israeli officials. The intelligence official said that the US was essentially told of the air raids “after the fact” and was notified as the bombs went off. Syria has condemned the attacks. “The Israeli invaders committed a blatant act of aggression against Syria on Sunday morning… by using missiles to attack a Syrian military facility,” said Omran al-Zoubi, Syrian Information Minister. Israel and Hezbollah fought a month-long war in 2006. The militant group fired thousands of rockets at Israel – while Israeli warplanes destroyed large areas of southern and eastern Lebanon. The conflict ended in stalemate.
