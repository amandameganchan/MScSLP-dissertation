# ORIG TITLE    Woman denied abortion by El Salvador court will have early caesarian . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A pregnant woman whose baby could only survive a few hours will undergo an early caesarian section, after El Salvador’s Supreme Court ruled she cannot have an abortion. The woman, named only as Beatriz to protect her identity, is carrying a 26-week-old foetus missing large parts of the brain and skull – a condition called anencephaly. She will have the caesarian instead of an abortion, despite being supported by the Ministry of Health and medical professionals. Women’s rights activist Irma Guirola said she welcomes the support from the Ministry of Health, but that this solution does not address the issue or help other women who could be in a similar situation. Beatriz, 22, had also argued that carrying a baby is risking her health because she suffers from lupus and kidney failure. However, the Supreme Court found her lupus was under control and not a threat to her life. El Salvador’s strict abortion law forbids terminations even in cases of rape, incest and when the pregnancy is a danger to the mother’s life. The law does not put the rights of the woman above the rights of the foetus.
