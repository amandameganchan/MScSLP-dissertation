# ORIG TITLE    Czech crown jewels on display . 
# ORIG CONTENT  After five years under wraps, the Czech crown jewels will go on display for the election of a new president. The crown jewels are precious symbols of Czech statehood and cultural heritage, on a par with Prague Castle. The Crown Chamber in St.Vitus Cathedral, where they are kept, is one of the most carefully guarded places in the city. There are seven keys to the chamber and each one of them is kept by a different person. The jewels were transported from St Vitus Cathedral to Vladislav Hall in Prague Castle, where they will remain for 10 days.
