# ORIG TITLE    US: Dreamliner takes to skies for test flight . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A Boeing Dreamliner plane took off on a test flight in the US on Monday, with the aim of proving that a new lithium-ion battery system meets safety standards. The hi-tech 787 jets were grounded worldwide in January, after batteries overheated on two separate aircraft. If the two-hour test flight is considered a success, a second test run is expected to be carried out in the “coming days.” . Getting passengers back on board the planes would be a huge boost for Boeing, which is losing tens of millions of euros every week and for airlines, which are barred from flying the 787. Some Boeing officials hope the Dreamliner will be back in service at the beginning of May. Experts have cautioned that it could take longer.
