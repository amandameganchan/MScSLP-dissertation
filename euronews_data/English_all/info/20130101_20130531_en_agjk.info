# ORIG TITLE    Left and right battle for Rome in mayoral elections . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Putting his legal battles to one side, former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi was all smiles as he cheered his party’s candidate for the mayoral elections in Rome. Incumbent mayor Gianni Alemanno is lagging behind in the polls, and it is unclear whether Berlusconi’s support is helping as he faces court cases for alleged fraud and for paying for sex with a minor. The frontrunner is Democratic party candidate Ignazio Marino who promised to bring back ‘honesty, transparency and culture’ to the eternal city. Marcello De Vito is running for the 5-star movement, the party of former comedian Beppe Grillo who took a quarter of the votes in national elections in February. Sixteen other candidates are standing including a monarchist who wants Italy to have a king again. Local elections will take place in over 500 districts with the results expected Monday night. If no one wins more than 50 percent of the vote, the two top candidates face a runoff in June 9-10.
