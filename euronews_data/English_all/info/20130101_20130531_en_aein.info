# ORIG CONTENT  Tourists in the French capital have been left frustrated by a strike by security staff at the Louvre. Guards at the world’s most visited museum shut its doors in protest over attacks and threats against them and visitors by pickpockets. But the wildcat action did not go down well with many visitors. Danielle, a British citizen living in New Zealand said: “My children have been brought up in New Zealand and it’s their first trip to Paris and the one thing they wanted to do, was to see Mona Lisa.” . Brazilian tourist, Edson Aguiar said: “We came to see the Louvre and it’s closed. We’re only here two days and then we’re leaving for Amsterdam so we are disappointed.” . With nine million visitors a year, the Louvre can afford to close its doors for a day but unions warn they are ready to take further action if necessary.
