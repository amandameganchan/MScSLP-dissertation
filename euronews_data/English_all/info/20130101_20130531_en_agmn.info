# ORIG TITLE    Bomb blasts heighten security fears in Iraq . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Iraq’s prime minister is to overhaul the country’s security strategy and personnel. Nuri al-Maliki’s announcement comes against a background of a wave of bombings. Monday’s blasts in mainly Shi’ite areas left at least 70 dead with scores of others injured. No group has claimed responsibility but Sunni Muslim insurgents and al Qaeda’s Iraqi wing have increased attacks on Shi’ite districts since the beginning of the year. Caught up the violence are ordinary people: . “We want to understand: why do they target us? Children, men and young boys were killed. What crimes have we committed?” asked Taha Ali whose flat was damaged in one of the explosions . The blasts are the latest indication that Iraq’s security is rapidly deteriorating. Tensions between the Shi’ite leadership and the Sunni minority are at their worst since US troops left in 2011. There are also concerns that the Syrian civil war is fanning the flames of sectarian polarisation .
