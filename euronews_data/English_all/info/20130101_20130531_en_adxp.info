# ORIG CONTENT  At least 21 bodies have been recovered from a landslide in Tibet, according to state media. 83 miners, most of them Chinese migrants, were buried by the slide on March 29. They were at a camp near Gyama village, around 70 kilometres east of the Tibetan capital Lhasa – when the mountain above them slipped, burying them under up to 30 metres of mud and rock. Over the weekend, thousands of rescue workers dug through the debris to look for the miners, and search efforts are continuing. State media says the chances of finding anyone alive are very slim. The mine is operated by a subsidiary of the China National Gold Group, the country’s largest gold producer.
