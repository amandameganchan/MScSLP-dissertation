# ORIG CONTENT  A prosecutor investigating the assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has been shot dead. Gunmen on a motorcycle lay in wait for Chaudhry Zulfikar as he left his home in Islamabad. The assassins then fired 12 bullets into Chaudhry and left him for dead. Bhutto’s killing has been shrouded in mystery. She was killed in a gun and bomb attack after an election rally in Rawalpindi in 2007. A UN commission said any credible probe into her death should not rule out the involvement of the security services. Tensions are high in Pakistan as the country goes to the polls on May 11.
