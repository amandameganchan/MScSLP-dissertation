# ORIG TITLE    Berlusconi Tax-Fraud Conviction Upheld . 
# ORIG CONTENT  An appeals court in Milan has upheld the tax fraud conviction and four-year prison sentence against Silvio Berlusconi . The case involving his television company could see the former Italian Prime MInister barred from public office for five years. The penalties however, would only come into force if the 3 stroke process allowed under Italian law has been exhausted. In other trials over the years, Mr Berlusconi has been accused of charges including accounting fraud, perjury, bribery and corruption all of which he has denied and has been been acquitted or let off under statutes of limitations . In October, a court convicted the 76 year old media mogul in a scheme that involved inflating the price, his Mediaset media empire paid for TV rights to U.S. movies and pocketing the difference. Berlusconi denies all charges and says heâ€™s a victim of politically motivated prosecutors.
