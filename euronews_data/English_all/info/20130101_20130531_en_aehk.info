# ORIG CONTENT  US President Barack Obama has launched a fresh attempt to introduce gun-control legislation. On a visit to Connecticut, scene of the Sandy Hook school massacre, he said Americans had to make their voices heard to honour the victims. “The day Newtown (massacre) . happened was the toughest day of my presidency. But I have got to tell you, if we do not respond to this, that will be a tough day for me too,” he said. Obama also called on Congress to stop politicking over the issue and take firm action. “This is about doing the right thing for all of the families who are here that have been torn apart by gun violence. It’s about them and all the families going forward so we can prevent this from happening again. That is what this is about.” . Along with Connecticut, several other states have adopted new gun laws but efforts to enact strong legislation remain stalled in Washington. However, it is thought a compromise could soon be reached over background checks, paving the way for tougher penalties for purchasing firearms illegally.
