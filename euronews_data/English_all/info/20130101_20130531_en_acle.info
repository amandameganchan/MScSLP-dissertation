# ORIG TITLE    Bersani wants change for parliament and Italy . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The leader of Italy’s Democratic Party, Pier Luigi Bersani, has given his first reaction to the political stalemate following Italy’s general election. Despite his party winning the largest number of seats in the lower house no clear majority has resulted in the Senate. That leaves the third largest economy in the eurozone in the political doldrums and prey to market jitters. It has also rejected austerity, the EU cure for the financial downturn. Bersani said: “ No to any discussion about alliances. Let us see what we have to do for change before parliament and the country. I don’t know what Berlusconi and Grillo have to say. Before it was politicians ‘get out of here’. Now they are in the parliament. They can get out of here or they can say what they will do for their country, the country of their children.” . The problems reside in the Senate; to govern the country a grouping must have a majority in both houses. For now the job in hand for the nearly winners, nearly losers is how to unravel the political spaghetti.
