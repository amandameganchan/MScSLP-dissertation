# ORIG TITLE    CeBIT: Sharing makes sense at Cebit . 
# ORIG CONTENT  CeBIT, in Hanover, Germany, is the the world’s top computer and IT fair. This year around 4,000 exhibitors from 70 different countries got behind the main themes of cloud computing, big data and sharing in cyberspace. “Shareconomy” was something of a motto at the fair. This year CeBIT was more consumer oriented and less of a playground paradise for the pros. German software developer SAP showed off their In-Memory-Computing software, HANA. Jim Hagemann Snabe, the CEO, said: “It is 10,000 times faster than traditional data-based technology. One example that we are showing is the DNA-analysis where we can now analyse the DNA of one individual patient and search for the right medical treatment for that explicit mutation in one patient.” . The Virtual Patient Model aims to find the right cure for cancer by searching for complete sequences of genomes from both the tumour and the patient. The trial system tries to predict which treatments work best and which could cause unwanted side effects. Another example of Big Data Management was the Manhattan showcase, an interactive map of Big Apple’s energy consumption. This project could be useful for managing energy grids in other big cities too. Another future trend: shopping with your smartphone. Just scan the QR Code. Or take a picture! Amnon Ribak, the project leader, explained: “An app idea from IBM Research uses image recognition to identify products on store shelves, then lets people sort those products by attributes such as price and nutrition information. The app taps into the augmented-reality technology by overlaying product information on the smartphone screen.” . The CMS Garden was a joint project by the German Open Source community, financed by donations. Florian Klare, Head of CMS Garden, said: “Here we are growing different ideas, we present 13 Content Management Systems form the Open Source sector. What we offer is first of all information about the existing systems, which target groups you can reach with them and how you can support them.” . The theme at CeBIT was ‘shareconomy’. But you don’t want to to share everything with everybody. Especially not with hackers or cyber-criminals. At CeBIT, exhibitors were demonstrating how to protect yourself from the attack over the internet. For example the German Chancellor’s tap-proof mobile. Hans-Christoph Quelle, the CEO of Secusmart, said: “This SD-card makes the official part of the mobile system so safe, that you can store government documents, send government mails, and also make safe, encrypted phone calls.” .
