# ORIG TITLE    All eyes on the Vatican as the papal conclave begins . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The secret conclave to select a new pope begins on Tuesday, March 12. Steeped in ritual and prayer the Roman Catholic cardinals are expected to reach a conclusion quickly, taking an average of just over three days in the last nine with none of them going over five days. Until then the world’s media will have their attention turned on the iconic chimney, for when white smoke appears it is the first signal that there is a new pontiff. On Tuesday morning the 115 cardinals attend a public mass at St Peter’s Basilica and then, in a tradition dating back to medieval times, they shut themselves into the Vatican’s Sistine Chapel, only to emerge when someone is chosen. For the moment there is no clear favourite to lead the scandal-ridden church, and the cardinals will have no outside contact until after a decision is reached. During what is normally the off-season local businesses have received a huge boost. The Vatican City has been full to the brim with thousands of tourists, pilgrims and journalists who flocked there after two weeks ago Benedict VXI became the first pontiff to step down in almost 600 years.
