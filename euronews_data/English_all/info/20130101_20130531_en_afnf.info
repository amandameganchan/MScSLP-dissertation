# ORIG CONTENT  A teenager accused of lying to FBI agents in the Boston Marathon bombing case has been freed on bail. Robel Phillipos, 19, will stand trial at a later date. He is accused of making false statements about last month’s attack that killed three people and injured 264 others. US authorities charged Phillipos and two 19-year-old students from Kazakhstan last week – alleging that they interfered with their investigation as a manhunt for the bombing suspects was underway.
