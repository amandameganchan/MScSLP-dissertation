# ORIG CONTENT  A political party in Greece is calling for the country to leave the euro and go back to using the drachma as its national currency. Plan B held its first general meeting in Athens on Saturday and is headed up by the former leader of the left-wing opposition Syriza party. So far, Plan B is a small party with only around 400 members. Describing the party’s stance on leaving the euro, Plan B founder Alekos Alavanos said: “The experience that we have from all the international recession crises is that no country has managed to come out of recession with an ‘expensive’ currency that’s also used by a great economic power, such as Germany. We need a currency that is competitive to ease exports and boost the internal market.” . “I believe that leaving the euro will give our country the possibility of developing an independent economic policy in favour of the people. The euro is a tight corset that prevents Greece from developing,” said ceramic artist Yannis Stavridis. Plan B is the second party to launch within a fortnight advocating a return to the drachma. Modeled on an Italian anti-austerity party, Drachma Five Star Movement was founded by Theodoros Katsanevas, the son-in-law of late Prime Minister and socialist PASOK founder Andreas Papandreou.
