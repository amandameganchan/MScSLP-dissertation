# ORIG TITLE    Eurovision: New beginnings for Estonia’s Birgit . 
# ORIG CONTENT  24-year-old Birgit Õigemeel will represent Estonia at the Eurovision Song Contest in Malmo in May. She sings New Beginnings – a very appropriate title as not only she is expecting her first child but she is beginning her Eurovision quest again after disappointment in 2008 and 2012. She said: “The song has a very beautiful meaning. It talks about new beginnings, which are different for each person, but mostly about that if something goes wrong in life, then you have to be strong and move on with your life. And there’s nothing bad if something goes wrong, it just makes you stronger in life.” . “During the Eurovision (contest) . I will be four months pregnant, though I don’t think it will be visible at all. But I believe that this wonderful experience – expecting a baby – will give a lot to the performance. Especially because the song talks about new beginnings and this is one of the new beginnings for me.” . Birgit won the first edition of Estonia’s talent contest – Estonia Pop Idol – in 2007. Since then she has released three albums and has performed in several plays and musicals. She will take part in the first semi final in Malmo on Tuesday.
