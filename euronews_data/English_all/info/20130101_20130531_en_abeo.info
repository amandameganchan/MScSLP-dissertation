# ORIG CONTENT  It is 200 years since Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice was published, and even after all that time it is showing little sign of losing any of its enormous popularity. Jane Austen’s portrayal of manners, morality and marriage in early 18th century England has continued to resonate through time. Pride and Prejudice has been translated into countless languages, selling 20-million copies. Curator of the Jane Austen House Museum, Louise West said: “I don’t think you’d say it was even her greatest novel, but it is certainly her most popular one. And it encompasses all that’s great about the other novels in the groundbreaking work that Jane Austen was doing in transforming the novel of the eighteenth century into a novel very much like the ones we read today.” . It has also spawned stage shows, including a musical production on Broadway and numerous incarnations on celluloid including a 2005 version with Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet. The year before that, it got the Bollywood treatment, transforming into Bride and Prejudice.
