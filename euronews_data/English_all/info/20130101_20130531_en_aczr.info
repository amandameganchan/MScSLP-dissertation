# ORIG TITLE    Protests against Berlusconi trial . 
# ORIG CONTENT  To the backing of the Italian national anthem centre-right parliamentarians protested outside a Milan court. They were demonstrating against Silvio Berlusconi going on trial charged with paying for sex with a minor. The protest came after judges ordered checks to be made on the 76-year-old after he claimed he could not attend the trial due to health problems. “We have an interlocutor, a go-between in whom we trust and that is the President of the Republic. He is also the President of the High Council of Magistrates. He is a wise man on whom we know we can rely. Our concerns are for Italian democracy and justice in this country,” said Angelino Alfano the secretary of Berlusconi’s People of Freedom party. Berlusconi, who faces a series of trials this month has been in hospital since Friday because of an eye problem. The former Italian prime minister denies having sex with a minor and claims he has been targeted by left wing judges who want to end his political career. The court also rejected a request by the 76-year-old’s two main lawyers for the trial to be delayed as they had to attend a meeting of his People of Freedom party. Another demonstration was held in Milan outside the Palace of Justice. One banner proclaimed “Enough! Twenty-years of corruption under Berlusconi” .
