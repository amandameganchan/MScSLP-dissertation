# ORIG TITLE    Another austerity strike paralyses Greece . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Greece is in the grip of yet another national strike. Much of the country is at a standstill. The two biggest unions called the 24-hour stoppage to protest against existing austerity measures, and those to come. Thousands gathered before the parliament in Athens to deliver their message that the belt-tightening policies will only deepen hardship that is already severe. One resident in the Greek capital, Vassilis Samidis, said: “This is one way to make those incompetents in government leave.” . Another pensioner, Dimitris, was more resigned. “The strike isn’t helping. Whatever will happen will happen. There’s no other way,” he said. It’s the deepest downturn debt-laden Greece has ever seen in peacetime. The Greek government is between two powerful forces. On one side, the troika of lenders who are demanding more austerity in exchange for emergency funds. On the other, Greeks who say enough is enough.
