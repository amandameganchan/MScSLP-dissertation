# ORIG TITLE    Azevedo to be new WTO boss . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Brazil’s Roberto Azevedo has won the contest to become the new leader of the World Trade Organisation. He replaces the two-term boss, France’s Pascal Lamy, from the first of September. The organisation will have its first leader from South America, and its first leader from an emerging economy since its creation in 1995. Azevedo, a former trade diplomat, won the contest after months of consultations had reduced the list of candidates to a straight fight between him and Mexico’s Erminio Blanco, a former trade minister. The first test for Azevedo will be to produce some sort of result at the WTO’s Bali summit in December, where members have to make some progress on the much-delayed Doha round of trade negotiations.
