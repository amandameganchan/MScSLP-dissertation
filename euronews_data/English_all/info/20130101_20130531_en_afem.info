# ORIG TITLE    Obama: Evidence chemical weapons used in Syria a ‘game changer’ . 
# ORIG CONTENT  President Barack Obama has confirmed evidence of chemical weapons being used in Syria. However, questions remain over their exact usage. During a briefing for reporters, the US leader reiterated his position to not make any hasty decisions without being absolutely sure of the facts. “What we now have is evidence that chemical weapons have been used inside of Syria but we don’t know how they were used, when they were used, who used them,” he explained. In the past Obama has said that evidence of chemical weapons employed by Bashar al-Assad’s regime against its citizens would be a ‘game changer’. “That is a game changer,” he confirmed, “because what that portends is potentially even more devastating attacks on civilians and it raises the strong possibilities that those chemical weapons can fall in the wrong hands.” . Clarifying his position, President Obama said he would review all available options, making his strongest indication yet of further intervention in the Syrian conflict, which until now has consisted of non-lethal aid to the rebels.
