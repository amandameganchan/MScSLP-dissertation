# ORIG CONTENT  Brazil’s Joao Havelange has resigned as Fifa’s honorary president after a report ruled he had taken bribes. The 96 year old, who led the world governing body for more than two decades, was described as “morally and ethically reproachable” for taking kickbacks from ‘International Sport and Leisure’, a World Cup rights marketing agency. The report released on Tuesday, compiled by FIFA’s ethics committee, also accused current president Sepp Blatter of “clumsy” handling over the ISL affair, but has ruled that he did not breach any ethics rules in the process. The news comes as FIFA prepares to meet next month in Mauritius for its annual congress where delegates will be asked to vote on governance changes.
