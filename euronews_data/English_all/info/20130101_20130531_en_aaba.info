# ORIG TITLE    Satirical French mag rethinks approach to Islam . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The satirical French weekly magazine, Charlie Hebdo, has released a special edition about Islam that may trigger fresh protests. It is publishing a comic book biography of the prophet Mohammed’s life. The magazine has previously sparked anger over its portrayals of Muslims but its publisher said this is completely different. Stephane Charbonnier, known as Charb, defended the comic book and its drawings. “Islam is the second religion in the country in terms of churchgoers, and in fact nobody knows anything about Mohammed, nobody knows anything about this religion.” . “It’s a religion that scares people because every time we talk about it, it’s when we talk about bomb attacks committed by an extreme minority. So I think that maybe we should have started with introducing Mohammed and introducing Islam before making fun of it or with it.” . Charlie Hebdo was forced to move into new premises in Paris after its offices were destroyed in a fire-bomb attack in November 2011. It came after the magazine retitled itself “Sharia Hebdo”, a reference to Islamic law and showed caricatures of radical Muslims.
