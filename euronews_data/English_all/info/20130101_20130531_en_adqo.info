# ORIG TITLE    Allez Hop! as Air France targets budget airlines . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Air France-KLM is trying to take on the low-costs with a new airline. Hop! has been created through the merger of its regional units Brit Air, Regional Air and Airlinair as part of a reshuffle of the group’s loss-making short and medium-haul operations. The new airline’s president, Lionel Guerin, said: “It’s really a renaissance of regional air transport in France and in Europe. We’ve got a lot of journeys all over in different areas. The aim is to win back clients with fares that are cheaper, more accessible and more transparent.” . This is all part of Air France- KLM’s plan to cut costs to pay back debt. Five thousand jobs will go in an attempt to turn around its short and medium-haul business, which lost 700 million euros in 2011. The head of Air France, Alexandre de Juniac, explained why they have created the new carrier: “We need the marketing and commercial strength under a new brand name which embodies dynamism, youth, creativity, marketing. We thought there was a strong need for that.” . De Juniac is just about to to step up into the big seat, from running Air France to being in charge of the whole group as Chief Executive and Chairman Jean-Cyril Spinetta steps down in just over three months time. A reshuffle of top executives is also intended to eliminate overlaps from the 2004 merger of Air France and KLM.
