# ORIG TITLE    Voters turn out for crucial Pakistan poll . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The polls have opened in Pakistan in national and provincial elections in a vote which marks the country’s first transition between civilian governments in its 66-year history. Widespread disenchantment with the two main parties appears to have brought a late surge of support for the former cricket star Imran Khan who could end up holding the balance of power. But that will only make it more difficult to drive through reforms needed to revive the country’s failing economy. In the run-up to the poll dozens of people have been killed. Thousands of police have had to be deployed at polling stations as the Pakistan Taliban has vowed to carry out suicide attacks on proceedings it regards as un-Islamic.
