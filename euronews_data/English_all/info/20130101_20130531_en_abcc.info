# ORIG TITLE    Egypt’s President Mursi faces growing calls to step down . 
# ORIG CONTENT  “Mursi, get out!” shout the demonstrators as they hold up empty teargas canisters and spent ammunition – the debris from running battles with police the night before. It is the anniversary of the uprising that ousted Hosni Mubarak from decades in power. But his successor is just as unpopular. President Mursi is facing calls for the demands of the revolution to be realised. Wael Ibrahim, one of the demonstrators, told euronews: “We went down into the streets to cast our votes, but we made a mistake and a bad choice. Our revolution isn’t about destruction. The revolution will make Egypt and its generations happy. Our demands are: dignity, humanity and a proper salary, we don’t need to live in villas.” . Mursi’s opponents claim that the Muslim Brotherhood – which propelled his rise to power – has betrayed them. The Arab Spring brought hope to many Egyptians. But for just as many others, real change and democracy are still tantalisingly out of reach.
