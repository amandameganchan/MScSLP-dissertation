# ORIG TITLE    Bahrain: protesters clash with police on the eve of Grand Prix . 
# ORIG CONTENT  One day before the eyes of the world are on Bahrain, protesters there are using the opportunity to draw attention to their demands for political reform. Police clashed with demonstrators on the streets of the capital Manama ahead of the Bahrain Grand Prix. There was also violence in nearly 20 other villages across the small island Gulf state, according to the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights. Pro-democracy protests began in February 2011, with the unrest causing that year’s Grand Prix to be cancelled. Campaigners have accused Bahrain’s ruling al-Khalifa family of using the Grand Prix to rebuild the country’s reputation and gloss over human rights violations. The government says it respects human rights.
