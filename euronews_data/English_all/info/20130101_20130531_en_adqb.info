# ORIG TITLE    Greeks look nervously at Cyprus . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Today is normally a day of joyful celebration in Greece, remembering the push for independence from Turkey in 1821, with military parades and a public holiday. Except that many are eyeing the plight of their Cypriot cousins who have just had to bite the financial bullet, and wondering if after a long recession worse is yet to come for them. “If you can’t trust a bank with your money, then what do you do? You don’t put it somewhere where someone could grab it to help bail out the country, so it’s a concern,” said an Australian tourist in Athens. “Things are really bad in Cyprus, so now we’re afraid that the same  thing will happen here, and we’re next,” said a Greek pensioner. “All the people of southern Europe must in some way get prepared to face this. It’s obvious there’s some sort of struggle going on between the north and south,” said a woman. Some of the hard-pressed Greeks retort that they will be safe, however, as they do not have any savings left.
