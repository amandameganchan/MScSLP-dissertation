# ORIG CONTENT  Prosecutors in Ohio say they may seek the death penalty in the case of Ariel Castro, the man accused of the kidnap and rape of three women held prisoner for a decade. Fifty-two year-old Castro could be facing aggravated murder charges stemming from the forced miscarriages the police say one of the women suffered at his hands. It is those charges which are a capital offence. “Based on the facts, I fully intend to seek charges for each and every act of sexual violence, rape, each day of kidnapping, every felonious assault, all his attempted murders and each act of aggravated murder he committed by terminating pregnancies that the offender perpetuated against the hostages during this decade-long ordeal,” announced Cuyahoga Country Prosecutor, Timothy McGinty. Meanwhile Castro’s mother was tracked down by journalists to give her reaction to her son’s alleged crimes. A distressed Lillian Rodriguez said she had a sick son who has committed something very grave and that she asked for forgiveness from the young girls and their mothers. Both Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus have now returned to their families, the third victim, Michelle Knight remains in hospital apparently refusing visits from relatives, some of whom thought she was just a runaway when she vanished. Gradually more details are emerging of their ten year ordeal but police say they need time to heal before seeking further evidence from them.
