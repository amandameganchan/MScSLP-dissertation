# ORIG TITLE    Japan unveils huge economic stimulus plan . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has announced an 87 billion euro stimulus package to create jobs and boost the recession-hit country. The move comes despite concerns about Japan’s public debt, which is already more than twice the size of its 3.7 trillion euro economy. Abe said: “I recognise that fiscal discipline is extremely important. I will aim towards returning the primary balance to the black.” . “But without economic growth, there is no hope for the future of Japan and for rebuilding our finances,” he added. The package aims to create more than half a million jobs and boost economic growth by two percent. The stimulus is a combination of construction projects, subsidies to companies and loan guarantees for small firms. Financial analysts, including investment bank Nomura, said the stimulus would give the economy a big lift. Japan’s Nikkei stock index jumped on the news, gaining 1.4 percent after Abe’s announcement.
