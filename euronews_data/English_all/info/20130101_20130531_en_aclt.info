# ORIG TITLE    Reports of arrests over Belaid killing in Tunisia . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Security sources have reportedly arrested three hardline orthodox muslims in connection with the killing of a high-profile Tunisian opposition politician earlier this month. Media reports suggest police have arrested three Salafists, including a police officer, in connection with the death of Chokri Belaid. There has been no official confirmation of the news. The assassination of Chokri Belaid ignited the biggest street protests since the overthrow of Tunisiaâ€™s strongman leader Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali two years ago. Tunisia was also plunged into a political crisis when the secular opposition politician was gunned down outside his house on February the 6th. The Prime Minister subsequently resigned after he failed to form a technocrat cabinet leading to an election.
