# ORIG CONTENT  Former US presidents Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton, as well as current president Barack Obama were at the opening of a presidential library in Dallas, Texas. Also there on the campus of Southern Methodist University was former president George W. Bush, who the library is named after. “As we walked through this library, obviously we’re reminded of the incredible strength and resolve that came through that bullhorn as he stood amid the rubble and the ruins of Ground Zero. Promising to deliver justice to those who had sought to destroy our way of life,” said President Obama, recounting the immediate aftermath of the September 11th terrorist attacks. Standing at the podium, Bush said: “I dedicate this library with an unshakable faith in the future of our country. It’s the honor of a lifetime to lead a country as brave and as noble as the United States.” . “Whatever challenges come before us, I will always believe our nation’s best days lie ahead. God bless,” he added, choking back tears.
