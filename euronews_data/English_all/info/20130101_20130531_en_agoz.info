# ORIG TITLE    Malaga’s Pellegrini has verbal deal with Man City . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Departing Malaga coach Manuel Pellegrini is no doubt hoping actions speak louder than words. The Chilean has been linked with a move to trophy-hungry Manchester City since the sacking of Roberto Mancini earlier this month, and now he says he has a verbal agreement with City which he wants to turn into a firm offer. “I have a commitment to make Manchester City my priority. I have a verbal agreement with them and I hope it is carried out,” the Chilean said. “But if you ask me today if I am Manchester City’s coach, I can’t say I am because I haven’t signed the contract,” he added. Last week, the 59-year-old former Villarreal and Real Madrid boss said he was leaving the Costa del Sol club at the end of the season after two and a half years at the helm. Pellegrini, known as ‘The Engineer’, has earned himself a reputation for constructing teams who play an attractive possession-based style though has been hindered by a track record in Spain that is devoid of major silverware.
