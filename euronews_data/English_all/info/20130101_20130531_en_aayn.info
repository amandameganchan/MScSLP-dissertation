# ORIG CONTENT  Google earnings from its core internet business came in much better than many analysts had predicted during the crucial fourth quarter of last year. They rose seven percent as online advertisers spent more money chasing holiday shoppers. For the whole fiscal year earnings by the world’s largest internet search company hit a record of $50 billion, that’s 37.5 billion euros. However, its Motorola mobile phone division continues to lose money with an operating loss of $353 million during the quarter. Google acquired Motorola Mobility last year, one of various “big bets” that Google Chief Executive Larry Page has made to better position the company for a changing technology landscape defined by mobile gadgets and social networking. “We now live in a multi-screen world,” said Page, adding that “we feel naked without our smartphone.” . Page said that Google had work to do in “managing our supply better as well as building a great customer experience,” but said Google remains squarely focused on opportunities around devices such as smartphones. Asked about the potential threat from Facebook’s recent launch of a social networking search product, Page cited Google’s years of online search experience and innovations such as voice-based search.
