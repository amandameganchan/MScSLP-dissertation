# ORIG TITLE    Discovered document may give insight into al-Qaeda in Mali . 
# ORIG CONTENT  News agency APTN have filmed a document which supposedly outlines how al-Qaeda insurgents operate in Mali. It is thought that nine pages found in a Timbuktu building which had been occupied by Islamic extremists, were mistakenly left behind as the rebels were forced out of the town at the end of January. According to the document, the rebels knew they were susceptible to foreign intervention and expected to be pushed out of Timbuktu. The writing also reveals divisions on how quickly and harshly to apply Islamic sharia law. The document appears to have been signed by Abu Musab Abdul Wadud, the nom de guerre of Abdelmalek Droukdel, the senior commander appointed by Osama bin Laden to run Al Qaedaâ€™s branch in Africa. With the 4,000 French troops set to start withdrawing from Mali next month, a top Tuareg officer who stayed loyal to the government is urging France to stay and drive out the rebels for good.
