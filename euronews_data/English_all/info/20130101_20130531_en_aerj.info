# ORIG CONTENT  German film “Das Leben ist nichts fur Feiglinge” or “Life is not for Cowards” is a tragi-comedy about a family coming to terms with bereavement. The movie was shown out of competition at the Berlin Film Festival and was premiered in Essen. Wotan Wilke Mohring, who plays the lead role of Markus Farber, when asked about his personal experience of being a coward, said: “I really have to think. There are some small occasions, perhaps sort of private conflict management, when you do not feel comfortable with something. But real cowardice, I don’t think so. I have no phobia, no scares, I really can’t think of anything.” . German film critics have given the movie a warm reception, noting that although the subject matter is serious, the film is full of wry comic moments as the characters come to terms with life and death.
