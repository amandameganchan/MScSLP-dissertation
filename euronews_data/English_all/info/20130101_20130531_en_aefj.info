# ORIG TITLE    Ukraine-EU ties warmer as Lutsenko freed . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The release from prison in Ukraine of a former minister of the interior has been seen as a move to improve the country’s relations with the European Union. Yuri Lutsenko was convicted of abuse of power in 2010, and sentenced to four years behind bars. He accepted a pardon from President Viktor Yanukovich. As he walked free, Lutsenko spoke with our correspondent in Ukraine. Lutsenko said: “I think now we are closer to the EU [prospects] and for me [that] is even more important than my freedom. Because it means freedom for all: for Ukraine and for millions of Ukrainians. I think that European authorities have done so much for this. The first step is very important. I like very much [what] American President [Franklin] Roosevelt said: “Where there is a will, there is a way”. Certainly, it is only a first step – and we understand that we have all problems with law, rules, lack of democracy here in Ukraine. But it is a very important first step.” . Yuri Lutsenko was one of the figures in the forefront of the Orange Revolution people’s uprising in 2004, which brought pro-westerners Viktor Yushchenko and Yulia Tymoshenko to prominence. She would become prime minister, and Lutsenko has close ties with her. She was handed a seven year sentence two years ago on charges she abused her power. This remains a source of conflict between Kiev and Brussels, and Ukraine’s opposition. Lutsenko said: “That is the greatest problem for me, and I hope I will visit her in the [coming] days. Certainly, it is a very important point, not only for Ukrainian politics, but for the direction of Ukraine’s EU prospects.” . There are no signs that Tymoshenko’s release might be expected soon. The pardons of Lutsenko and ex-ecology minister Heorhiy Filipchuk have been cautiously welcomed by Brussels, but the EU continues to condemn what it calls ‘selective justice’ in Ukraine.
