# ORIG TITLE    Promoters’ ‘pressure’ on Jackson contributed to singer’s death, claim family . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Members of the Jackson family are in a LA court as a lawsuit into the death of the ‘King of Pop’ Michael Jackson continues. Katerine Jackson, the singers mother, is suing AEG Live the promoters of a series of comeback concerts for negligence. The family believe AEG Live hired and failed to vet Dr. Conrad Murray before he was employed as Jackson’s personal physician. Lawyers for AEG Live say Jackson selected Murray and he was never an AEG employee. The Jackson’s insist that Murray was under pressure from AEG to get Jackson ready for the tour, despite his delicate health. Conrad Murray is currently serving a four-year jail term for involuntary manslaughter after he was found guilty of administering a combination of sedatives and the anaesthetic propofol, which led to the singers death. Murray is currently appealing his conviction. A former Jackson lawyer believes the family are in a strong position in the case: “They were putting pressure on Conrad Murray to make Jackson perform, and I think they’re going to have a tough time getting out of that. I think the absolute momentum is with Katherine Jackson and Michael’s children,” said Michael A. Mesereau. Billions of dollars are at stake in the case that could last up to 90 days.
