# ORIG TITLE    Kenya on tenterhooks ahead of presidential vote . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Kenya will vote for a new president on Monday, in a fraught election overshadowed by rampant corruption, divisive tribal politics and the threat of violence. A new online voting system has been brought in to limit the opportunity for fraud. Officials want to prove they have moved on after the 2007 vote which unleashed weeks of bloodshed. The two leading candidates held final rallies in Nairobi on Saturday. Raila Odinga is from the Luo tribe. His father was the country’s first vice president. Uhuru Kenyatta, meanwhile, is Kikuyu, and is the son of Kenya’s founding president. Polls show both men in a close race, with support for each in the mid-40 percent range. 14 million people are expected to cast their vote. An estimated 99, 000 police officers will be on duty.
