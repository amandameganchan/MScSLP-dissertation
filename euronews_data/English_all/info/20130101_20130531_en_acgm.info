# ORIG CONTENT  Wednesday night’s Brit Awards were a chance for one of the biggest musical nations on earth to honour its homegrown talent, although one star performer couldn’t be there in person. Adele, who won the Brit for ‘Best Single’ for the James Bond theme ‘Skyfall’, missed the star-studded show at London’s O2 Arena. “Hello everyone. Thank you very much for this Brit award. It means a lot. Sorry I can’t be with you tonight. I’m in LA rehearsing for the Oscars,” she told the audience in a recorded message from the Hollywood. ‘Best British Album’ went to 25-year-old Emeli Sande, who received a major boost by performing at the London Olympics’ opening and closing ceremonies last summer. She also won the ‘Best British female’ gong. The other multiple winner was singer-songwriter Ben Howard, rewarded for the ‘Best Breakthrough Act’ and ‘Best Male Solo’. ‘Best British Group’ went to Mumford and Sons while Coldplay were awarded ‘Best Live Act’ beating The Rolling Stones.
