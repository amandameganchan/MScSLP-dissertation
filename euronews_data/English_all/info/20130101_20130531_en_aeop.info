# ORIG TITLE    Iraq hit by a wave of deadly bomb strikes . 
# ORIG CONTENT  At least 20 people have been killed and more than 200 others hurt in a series of deadly car bombs and attacks across Iraq. A number of cities have been targeted, including Baghdad, Kirkuk and Tuz Khurmato. Two people were killed by car bombs that exploded at a Baghdad airport checkpoint, police sources said. Attacks on the heavily guarded airport and the fortified International Zone housing many embassies are rare, but insurgents have stepped up bombings this year. No one has claimed responsibility for the bombings, but al Qaeda’s local wing, Islamic State of Iraq, and other Sunni Islamist groups have vowed to wage a campaign against Shi’ites and the government to stoke sectarian tensions. The attacks come just days before Iraqis vote in provincial elections that will test political stability more than a year after U.S. troops left the country.
