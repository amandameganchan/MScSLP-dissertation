# ORIG TITLE    Chaos at carnival as Rio goes for the record. 
# ORIG CONTENT  Rio’s oldest street party attracts masses, but has left revellers dazed and confused. Over 2 million people attended the Bola Preta, with Guinness world record officials on hand to count whether it would be the largest audience ever. However, after 7 hours the 30 degree heat and sheer size of the celebrations meant many party goers had to seek medical attention as the carnival descended into chaos. Two police cars entered the crowded area which allegedly caused panic, with people climbing fences and lamposts to escape the crush. The incident has raised eyebrows with commentators questioning the country’s ability to handle events of this magnitude. Brazil is to host the World Cup next year and the Olympics in 2016. City officials have opened an inquiry to make sure that incidents like this can never happen again.
