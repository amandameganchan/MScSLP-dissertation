# ORIG CONTENT  Ireland wants to mark a successful EU presidency by taking more steps on the road to economic recovery. That was the message from the country’s prime minister Enda Kenny after a meeting between Irish officials and the European Commission. Dublin is eyeing an exit from the troika’s bailout programme before the end of the year. “Ireland’s recovery is in Europe’s interest and obviously in our own interest – and that’s part of our ambition as presidency,” said Kenny. The Taoiseach and his deputy, Eamon Gilmore, said Ireland could serve as a model to other indebted eurozone countries. European Commission chief Jose Manuel Barroso echoed their views, arguing that “restoring confidence is key” and that the question of a euro breakup is “no longer there”. The trio were speaking after a meeting between Irish officials and European Commissioners .
