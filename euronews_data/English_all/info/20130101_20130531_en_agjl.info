# ORIG TITLE    Two more for Palme d’Or . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Day ten of the Cannes film festival, and two more movies competing for the top prize. French Oscar winner Marion Cotillard together with Joaquin Phoenix star in one of the entries for the Palme d’Or, “The Immigrant”. It’s about a young woman, played by Cotillard who arrives in America at the turn of the century. Her character, Ewa, is forced into a life of burlesque by Joaquin Phoenix’s character, Bruno Weiss, until a magician, Orlando, played by Jeremy Renner tries to save her. ‘The Immigrant’ has echoes in today’s treatment of Mexicans in the US, which was the director’s intention. It vividly portrays the teeming life in New York in the 1900s. But it has opened to mixed reviews in the US. Meanwhile, another entry, ‘Michael Kohlkaas’ stars Mads Mikkelsen, who won best actor at Cannes last year. Set in the 1700s in France and based on a German novel, it’s about a a horse trader who takes up arms against a local lord.
