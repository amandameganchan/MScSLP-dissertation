# ORIG CONTENT  Malaysians are voting in a general election which could see the opposition taking power for the first time in over half a century. Hundreds of people have lined up outside polling stations across the country, many of them first-time voters concerned about high living costs and corruption. Prime Minister Najib Razak’s ruling Barisan Nasional coalition is up against growing momentum for change especially among young Malaysians. With the three-party opposition alliance, Pakatan Rakyat under Anwar Ibrahim pledging to clean up politics the result could see ethnic Chinese and Indians rejecting the ruling coalition’s race-based patronage system which has ensured stability but led to corruption. More then 13 million people are eligible to vote and opinion polls suggest a tight race for the 222 parliamentary seats. There are concerns that accusations of fraud in the run-up to the elections could spill over into street protests.
