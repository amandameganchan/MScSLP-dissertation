# ORIG CONTENT  Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad has offered his resignation to President Mahmoud Abbas following a rift over government policy. Western states have shown strong support for the US-educated economist since he took office in 2007. They see him as the architect of Palestinian state-building efforts. It is not clear whether Abbas – who is due back from a visit to Jordan later on Thursday – will accept the resignation, but if he does it may well damage his international ties.
