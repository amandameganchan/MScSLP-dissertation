# ORIG TITLE    Vatican City turns media city ahead of papal conclave . 
# ORIG CONTENT  As the Roman Catholic Church’s Cardinals meet at the Vatican to discuss the election of a new pope the modern world meets the ancient as the world’s media gathers to report every whisper. Viviane Lee from New York News TV told us: “It’s something that is of great journalistic interest. It is of interest to anyone who is an observer of spiritual affairs, of government affairs, of politics in the world. So, I have always considered the job of reporter-journalist-anchor to be quite privileged because we get to see the inside before anybody else does.” . In a world of lightening fast communication, just how important is it for the new pope to be media savvy? . Ronaldo da Silva who travelled to Vatican City for Brazilian television has an opinion on that: “We live in a 24-7 media world and it makes a big difference if someone knows how to communicate and use communication tools and speak the language of the modern world.” . It is ironic that all those involved with the election of a new pope are sworn to secrecy and the conclave itself is a secret process, yet hundreds of journalists are just metres away. Euronews’ correspondent in Vatican City, Fabian Farge, concluded: “The media presence here is unprecedented since the death of John Paul II. The shock resignation of Benedict XVI and the election of a new pope has mobilised the world’s media, it is similar to the Olympics or the World Cup, everyone wants to cover this event live.” .
