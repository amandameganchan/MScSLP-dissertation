# ORIG CONTENT  The leader of Syria’s National Coalition has said they are ready to accept dialogue with the country’s vice president, Farouk al-Shara. But Moaz Al Khatib stressed the departure of Bashar al-Assad is a necessary precondition to any talks taking place. Al Khatib said during a television interview: “Since the beginning of the conflict, Farouk al-Shara has known that things weren’t going well. Just because he is part of the regime does not mean that we cannot talk to him. I call on the regime to allow Shara to talk to us. Where is the problem in that?” . At the same time footage posted on a social media website is said to show Syrian government forces pounding neighbourhoods across the capital, Damascus. Plumes of smoke rise into the air above Kafar Batna. It is claimed footage from the streets below shows the aftermath of a direct hit on a hospital.
