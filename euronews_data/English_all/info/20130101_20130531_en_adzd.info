# ORIG TITLE    Colorado prosecutor demands death penalty for cinema shooter . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Prosecutors in the Aurora Cinema shooting trial have called for the death penalty for accused gunman James Holmes. He is to go on trial for the shooting of 12 people last July at the opening of the latest movie in the “Batman” franchise. Minus his orange hair and now with a full beard Holmes heard the demand in silence in court before he was led away. His alleged rampage was one of the deadliest mass shootings in America in recent years, and also left 58 people wounded. A dozen others were injured as they fled the cinema in panic. The incident was one of several last year that re-energised the debate over gun control in the USA, and led to renewed calls for the banning of large-capacity magazines and automatic weapons that allow a rogue killer to inflict so much damage. Immediately after the Denver prosecutor called for the death penalty there was an almost unanimous expression of local public support for the decision.
