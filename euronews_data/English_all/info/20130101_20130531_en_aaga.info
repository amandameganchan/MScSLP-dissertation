# ORIG CONTENT  Social network Facebook is under fire again for privacy issues after a woman in Iceland became the subject of a bitter hate campaign. She dared to criticise a rather macho Facebook page that was sneering at women. Her photoshopped face then appeared, bruised, along with rape threats and insults. “I would like to see the examples of images that are okay for Facebook, and those which are not. I’d like to know their rules,” says Thorlaug Agustsdottir. Despite repeated appeals, Facebook did not immediately take action against the hate post. The company’s own rules say it will not tolerate preudice or intolerance, so this latest incident is another sign Facebook’s checks and balances aren’t working. “Some people are paid to evaluate these kinds of problems, but where they are, how much time they spend on it, and how many reports they get a month, and how they deal with them is really unknown,” says social media advisor Trine Maria-Kristensen. Investors may be worried it is only a matter of time before lax policy at Facebook exposes the company to legal action of some kind. Personal indiscretions have already led to several individuals losing their jobs over comments posted on Facebook or similar sites.
