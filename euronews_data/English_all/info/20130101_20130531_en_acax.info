# ORIG TITLE    Anastasiades wins but will face run-off in Cyprus presidential election . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Conservative opposition leader Nicos Anastasiades has won the presidential election in Cyprus, but has not done enough to avoid a run-off on February 24.   Earlier, exit polls indicated he had won by over 50 percent – the threshold needed to win outright. However, he only achieved 45.3 percent.   In the second round, Anastasiades will face Stavros Malas, a leftwing candidate who has the backing of ruling communist party AKEL. Malas won 27.1 percent in Sunday’s ballot.   Proposals for ending the recession by boosting tourism and attracting foreign investment were not enough for independent candidate George Lilikas, who got around 25 percent.   Whoever wins the next week’s run-off will take office on March 1 and must face the country’s economic crisis.   Sixty-six year old Anastasiades remains the favourite.
