# ORIG TITLE    Hirscher back on track . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Austria’s Marcel Hirscher got back to winning ways on Sunday after the overall world cup leader won a slalom at the Swiss resort of Adelboden. After making a mistake whilst leading in the giant slalom on Saturday (he eventually finished 16th)Hirscher bounced back in style to win his third consecutive slalom this winter. He was eighth after the first leg, but bombed down the course in the second to win the race and extended his lead in the general standings to 126 points over Norway’s Aksel Lund Svindal . Veteran skier Mario Matt finished second three tenths of a second behind for his 36th career world cup podium. The 33-year-old Austrian, who also finished on the podium in Zagreb a week ago, was second after the morning run and maintained his position following the afternoon leg to move up to seventh in the discipline standings. Manfred Moelgg was fastest in the first leg therefore last to go out in the second run. But the Italian couldn’t match his own pace in the afternoon and had to settle for third place, 0.62 seconds adrift. As Moelgg picked up his first slalom podium spot in three years Hirscher was left celebrating his fourth victory of the season. The men’s circuit remains in Switzerland for a weekend of racing in Wengen.
