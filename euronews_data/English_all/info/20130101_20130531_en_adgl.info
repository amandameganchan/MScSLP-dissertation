# ORIG TITLE    Israeli government takes shape ahead of Obama visit . 
# ORIG CONTENT  As Israel prepares for a visit by US President Barack Obama, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has named Moshe Yaalon, a right-wing former armed forces chief, as his defence minister. Yaalon – who favours defence before diplomacy – shares Netanyahu’s reluctance to give up the occupied West Bank and make way for a Palestinian state. Presenting his cabinet, the prime minister said Yaalon’s experience was needed to tackle the challenges in a turbulent Middle East. However, Yaalon is reportedly more cautious than Netanyahu about any attack against Iran to curb its nuclear programme. That topic – along with the Middle East peace effort – will be high on the agenda during US President Obama’s visit to the country where he is not popular. That starts on Wednesday. Obama will be on a listening tour of Jerusalem and – briefly – to Ramallah in the West Bank, with the White House playing down hopes of progress. The right-wing makeup of the new Israeli government, which followed weeks of difficult negotiations pleased Jewish settlers. Settlement resident Shani Taragn said: “I think that with those that are now in charge I think that there is a tremendous future for building in the settlements. I think that the government now represents the people’s desires to continue building here, recognising the necessity of building in the area of Judea and Samaria.” . But in Gaza Dr. Salah Bardaweel, Hamas Palestinian Legislative Council member, lamented: “If the previous government was considered a fundamentalist one, then this one is even more fundamentalist with the addition of these two parties (Yesh Atid and Jewish House). So I don’t think with this government there is a political horizon or even a humane one. The situation will be even worse in the future.” . Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat tried to be upbeat. He noted the cabinet includes – as justice minister – Tzipi Livni who is expected to put strong pressure on Netanyahu to take a softer line toward the Palestinians. Erekat said the Palestinians would be happy talking to Livni, and urged the new government to work towards a two-state solution: “The formation of the new Israeli government is a domestic Israeli matter. We hope that this Israeli government will announce its acceptance of the two-state solution on the 1967 borders. We need to hear this sentence from them.” . Other Palestinians preferred to send Obama the message that Israel is an oppressor, pointing out they will not even allow 3G mobile access . They erected posters in Ramallah reading: “President Obama, don’t bring your smart phone to Ramallah, you won’t have mobile access to Internet. We have no 3G in Palestine!” .
