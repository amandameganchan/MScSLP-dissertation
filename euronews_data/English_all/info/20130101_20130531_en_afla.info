# ORIG TITLE    Thank you for the music . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Almost 40 years after they shot to fame by winning the Eurovision song contest, ABBA’s very own museum is opening in Stockholm. It traces their careers from their early days all the way to when they became Sweden’s biggest band in the 1970s and early 1980s. But among the memorabilia there is a very modern touch as well: Museum director Mattias Hansson said: “We have the guitars, the drums the mixing tables and the studio. We have all that classical memorabilia. We actually don’t lack anything significant. But then we wanted to add something more to make it a really fun experience. “So for example you can become the fifth member of ABBA here by entering the stage where they are in hologramme illusions,while at the same time your performance is being filmed and put on your ticket and homepage because each ticket to ABBA the museum is connected to an individual ABBA home page.” . The idea of a museum dedicated to Sweden’s most famous musical export dates back to 2008. But it was really when former ABBA member, Bjorn Ulvaeus got involved in the project that things took off. He explained: “Museums are about dead people usually. I thought you know it’s the kind of thing you don’t get involved with yourself. Kind of weird, kind of narcissistic. But then about a year ago, it suddenly dawned on me that this is now going to happen in my home town. People will want to go there and they ask me what is it like. And when I realised that I thought I had to get involved to make sure that they do everything to make it as good as possible and I’m glad I did because it’s been great fun as well to tell this story again.” . ABBA the museum officially opens its doors to the public on May 7. For fans, there will be plenty of time to say thank you for the music….
