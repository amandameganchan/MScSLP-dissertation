# ORIG TITLE    Thousands of Palestinians gather to commemorate ‘Nakba’ . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Thousands of Palestinians gathered in Ramallah for the annual day of commemoration for what they call ‘Nabka catastrophe’. It is to mark the day in 1948 when they left or were forced to leave their homes. All over the West Bank, the sirens sounded at noon for 65 seconds – the number of years since then. Demonstrations were held in other parts of the West Bank, as well as the Gaza Strip. Some carried a huge map of the Middle East, others held Palestinian flags or keys to symbolise the homes they left. Protesters clashed with Israeli security forces at the Qalandiyah checkpoint between Ramallah and Jerusalem. Others threw stones at troops close to the barrier. The dispute over the fate of the Palestinians, and their descendants who now number several million, remains a divisive issue in the Middle East.
