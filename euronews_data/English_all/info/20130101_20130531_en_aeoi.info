# ORIG TITLE    Call for Arctic protection . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A trek to the North Pole organised by Greenpeace has ended with four young explorers including American actor Ezra Miller planting a flag on the seabed. It was lowered in a time capsule containing the signatures of nearly three million people calling for a ban on exploitation in the region. They want the Arctic to be declared a global sanctuary and protected from oil drilling.
