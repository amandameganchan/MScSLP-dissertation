# ORIG TITLE    US gun-rush is on as controls loom on the horizon . 
# ORIG CONTENT  America’s war over guns is hotting up in the wake of the Newtown shootings, with media reports that the White House is set to challenge the second amendment as never before. Some are not waiting for President Obama to take their guns away, and are flocking to arms fairs to pick up an assault rifle before they, along with high-capacity magazines, are banned. “They’re afraid they’ll lose their gun rights, their Second Amendment right. So, they want to get a gun and hopefully they’ll be grandfathered in, so if Mr. Obama makes any changes, they’ll be covered,” said one man, the aptly-named Mr. Derringer. So business is booming, although measures under consideration include tougher background and mental health checks on buyers, tracing the movement and sale of weapons, and stiffer penalties for carrying guns near schools or giving them to minors. Vice President Joe Biden is leading a working group to try and bypass the powerful National Rifle Association lobby, and is including tactics such as rallying retailers like Wal-Mart to the cause by arguing controls will be good for their trade.
