# ORIG TITLE    Pinturault victorious as Hirscher increases overall lead. 
# ORIG CONTENT  Alexis Pinturault showed off his all-round skill, claiming his first ever giant slalom victory. The Frenchman clocked a time of 2:32.42 seconds in Kandahar. It is 21-year-oldâ€™s fourth World Cup victory, all in different disciplines. He has also won a slalom and super-combined this winter and won parallel slalom last season. Second place went to World Cup leader Marcel Hirscher. The Austrian had a sub-standard morning run, but fought hard in the second leg to finish 0.60 seconds adrift. The third spot on the podium went to three-time world champion Ted Ligety. The American, who is fresh from claiming three golds in Schladming earlier this month, finished 0.63 seconds off the pace.
