# ORIG TITLE    Bulgaria blames Hezbollah for Burgos bomb . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Bulgaria has accused the Lebanese-based militant organisation Hezbollah of being behind the Burgos bus bombing last July, which killed five Israelis. The accusation may lead the EU to follow the US’s lead and classify Hezbollah as a terrorist organisation. “A justified assumption could be made, that these two persons with already established identity belonged to armed units of Hezbollah,” said Bulgaria’s Interior Minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov. In all three people were involved in the attack, all using fake American driving licences printed in Lebanon. The Bulgarians claim they were part of a Hezbollah cell, and that after a six-month investigation they had proof of financing and a connection between the men and Hezbollah. In Israel Prime Minister Netanyahu welcomed the findings. He said Hezbollah and its backers Iran were waging a “global terror campaign” and hoped Europe would take note of Hezbollah’s true character.
