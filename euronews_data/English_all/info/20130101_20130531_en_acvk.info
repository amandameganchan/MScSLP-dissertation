# ORIG CONTENT  A son-in-law of Osama bin Laden has been arrested and flown to the United States. Suleman Abu Ghaith was picked up in Turkey and flown to Jordan where he was taken into custody by the FBI and transported to New York. Abu Ghaith first surfaced in videos following the 9/11 attacks and quickly became the main spokesperson for al- Qaeda . He is currently being held in a detention centre in New York City where he will be charged and eventually be tried in a federal court. Peter King, a senior Republican member of the House of Representatives said, “Propaganda statements in which Abu Ghaith and his late father-in-law, Osama bin Laden, praised the terrorist attacks of September 11, are alone enough to merit the most serious punishment.” .
