# ORIG CONTENT  The German opposition party, the Social Democrats, are losing support according to the latest opinion poll carried out ahead of Germany’s general elections on September 22nd. Peer Steinbrück has been in Augsburg near Munich to present his centre-left party’s official platform. However, the latest figures are sure to be a blow to the former finance minister who received a standing ovation from the crowd. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrat alliance would take 46 percent of the vote compared to the SPD-Green alliance who would win 41% if the election was held this past week. Merkel also ranks high in the approval ratings. Steinbrück has faced criticism for his high personal earnings, however he has vowed to have equal pay for women, spend more money for education and ensure more affordable housing.
