# ORIG TITLE    Bayern European champions for fifth time . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Bayern Munich are the new champions of Europe, the men from Bavaria beating their rivals from Dortmund 2-1 in the Championsâ€™ League final at Wembley. In a goalless first half Dortmund impressed, taking the game to the German champions, but for all the chances they created they could not convert one. Zero-zero at half time, but it was Bayern who came out more determined in the second half, and Dortmund who lost their sparkle. When the goals came, they came late, with just half an hour to go.
