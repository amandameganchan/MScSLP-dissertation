Several members expressed concern that deep cuts to EU funding will put several public works projects at risk. Parliament president Martin Schulz said: “My colleagues and I are not ready to accept that member states make the same mistakes on the European level that they have at home – that they agree a ‘deficit’ budget that will be overstretched. I’m saying quite clearly that I won’t sign any such agreement.” . The budget can by blocked by MEPs who will vote on it once EU leaders reach a deal.

British Prime Minister David Cameron, supported by Germany and the Netherlands, is pushing for deeper cuts. He says the EU spends too much on agriculture and administration costs.
