# ORIG TITLE    Bethlehem protesters give Obama poster the boot ahead of visit . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A group of Palestinians in Bethlehem in the West Bank showed disdain for President Obama’s forthcoming visit. He is due at the Nativity church later in the week as part of his middle east trip. The protesters tore down a poster bearing Obama’s image and set about it with their shoes, a sign of insult in the Arab world. The poster, telling Obama not to bring his smartphone because there is no 3G network, had been put up by activists. It refers to the fact that Israeli authorities have denied the use of the high-speed frequency to Palestinian mobile phone operators. The protesters carried banners saying: “no one shall be subjected to torture or cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment.” .
