# ORIG TITLE    Party leader blasts personality politics ahead of Italy election . 
# ORIG CONTENT  He is the clear leader in the latest polls in Italy and now Pier Luigi Bersani has sent an unequivocal message to the voters ahead of the country’s February ballot. The 61-year-old Democratic Party boss slammed the new alliance which former PM Silvio Berlusconi has formed with the Northern League and he has questioned Mario Monti’s formation of a new party and his hopes for a second term. “I want to know in which European country, in which democratic country in the world, France, Germany, Holland, Spain the United States, the political forces organise themselves around personalities? For me this is a question at the very foundation, three years ago I said I would never put my name on a party symbol because it is one of the major problems of our country. These mechanisms create rigidity and instability”. “With Monti for Italy” is the the slogan of Monti’s new party. It is part of a centrist bloc which according to the latest poll is now in third place. It is turning out to be a bitter battle of several factions in the EU’s third largest economy. But analysts believe it is Silvio Berlusconi’s centre right alliance which could determine the balance of power. They are second in the polls but could win enough Senate seats to block control of parliament.
