# ORIG TITLE    Real Madrid with a mountain to climb against Dortmund . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Real Madrid will be hoping to bounce back from their humiliating 4-1 defeat to Borussia Dortmund last week when both sides meet again in the second leg of their Champions League semi final clash at the Bernabeu on Tuesday. It may seem like a mountain to climb, but such comebacks have happened before: teams trailing 4-1 after the first leg have emerged victorious after the second leg 12 times in the history of European football. Los Merengues are likely to welcome Alvaro Arbeloa back into the defence after his suspension for the first leg while former Manchester United winger Cristiano Ronaldo is expected to be in the starting lineup after overcoming a thigh strain. Borussia coach Jurgen Klopp may have to make do without the services of full-back Lukasz Piszczek, who has picked up a groin injury while Ilkay GÃ¼ndogan should return after having been rested over the weekend. Dortmund, who are undefeated in their last eleven games have reached the final once before back in 1997 when they downed Juventus 3-1 to lift the trophy. The game kicks off at 20.45 local time.
