# ORIG TITLE    Neymar transfer saga set to run and run as Spanish giants battle it out for striker . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A busy Saturday of transfer action over Santos star Neymar saw Barcelonaâ€™s offer trumped by Real Madrid, only for Barcelona to return at the charge putting over 30 million euros on the table for the 21 year-old Brazilian. Real then reportedly made an offer of 100 million, although that has to be confirmed. Barcelona has warned the striker, who many at home say is the new Pele, that he has a pre-deal arrangement with them and if he should go somewhere else they will see him in court. However such is the feeding frenzy around Neymar with clubs upping the bidding against each other he would be foolish not to see what comes up. With money no object for some, this transfer saga could run and run.
