# ORIG TITLE    Bulgaria’s referendum on power . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Bulgarians are voting in a referendum on whether to build a second nuclear power station. Opinion polls say the electorate are likely to say a big ‘yes’ to the plant. Even though electoral rules mean the result is unlikely to make any difference, that does not mean the vote is going to be ignored. Bulgaria already has one atomic power plant. The conservative prime minister Boiko Borisov said the country could not afford a second and he cancelled it after work had started. So a resounding vote in favour of restarting the project would be seen as a major slap in the face for his austerity measures. The economy has emerged from recession, but Bulgarians enjoy, on average, only half the wealth that other EU citizens do. If they vote against Borisov over an idle building site, they could well do it again at the next election, and that is when they choose a new parliament in July.
