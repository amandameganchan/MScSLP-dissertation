# ORIG CONTENT  Germany’s chancellor Angela Merkel is maintaining her support for her education minister, at the centre of a plagiarism scandal. Annette Schavan’s chair was empty at the cabinet meeting – she is on a trip to South Africa. There, she struck back at Düsseldorf University which stripped her of her PhD saying parts of the thesis had been copied. “I will not accept the unversity’s decision, and I will take legal action against it,” she said. Calls for Schavan to go are mounting from opposition MPs and the media. The top-selling Bild newspaper said if she has cheated, it would be like the transport minister driving while drunk. A friend and ally of Merkel, she has been education minister since 2005, and that means overseeing Germany’s universities. One student in Frankfurt said an education minister could not be allowed to do such a thing and she should resign. Another said that it was a slap in the face for all students and lecturers. For the moment, Schavan has the ‘full trust’ of the chancellor’s office. But Germany has an election later in the year – the date has been set for September 22.
