# ORIG TITLE    Queen pays tribute to murdered fusilier . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Her majesty Queen Elizabeth II has made a scheduled visit to Woolwich barracks in London, where slain British soldier Lee Rigby was stationed. Just nine days ago he was walking the nearby streets, returning from a recruiting event at the Tower of London, when he was killed in broad daylight. His death and its shocking circumstances have stirred people everywhere. Amongst them the Queen, who came to honour one of her own; Rigby was a ceremonial drummer whose death caused her to express public concern last week. At the same time the inquest into the circumstances of the death at Southwark Coroner’s Court heard evidence from the police. They confirmed eye-witness reports that Rigby had been run over by a vehicle causing “extensive and serious injuries” by two men armed with a knife and cleaver, who then attacked him. The police also confirmed their own post-mortem of cause of death from “multiple incised wounds”. The court adjourned shortly after.
