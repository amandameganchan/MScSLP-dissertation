# ORIG TITLE    No deal in Iran-IAEA nuclear talks . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Talks between UN nuclear negotiators and Iran on investigating the country’s suspected atomic weapons programme have once again failed to result in a deal. The failure comes just two weeks before more meetings, this time between Iran and six world powers over the nuclear programme. Arriving back in Vienna from the discussions in Tehran, the deputy director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Herman Nackaerts said: “Our commitment to continue dialogue is unwavering. We will work hard now to try and resolve the remaining differences.” . The West suspects Iran of using its nuclear programme as a front for developing atomic weapons. The IAEA wants to inspect Parchin military site but has been denied access. Iran says its nuclear programme is purely for peaceful purposes.
