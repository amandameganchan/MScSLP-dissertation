# ORIG TITLE    Ex-Yugoslavia war crimes tribunal marks 20 years of business . 
# ORIG CONTENT  This weekend marks the 20th anniversary of the creation of the UN special war crimes tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. The court in the Hague has indicted 161 people and sentenced 136. Two dozen cases are ongoing. The tribunal’s business is due to wind up by 2016. The arrest of Serbia’s former President Milosevic was a breakthrough. But the tribunal has been criticised for the time taken to complete high-profile trials.
