# ORIG CONTENT  Adrian Lancashire, euronews: . “Tahman Bradley in Boston, where you are right now nobody can relax I imagine: there’s a police order for people to stay indoors, the marathon bombs, followed by shock, then a shootout with suspects. How are people reacting?” . Tahman Bradley, abc news: . “It’s a remarkable scene to see here the entire city of Boston is on lockdown as well as the suburbs, millions of people are being effected by this. “It is an unprecedented police operation underway, law enforcement officials say they don’t recall seeing a situation this tense in many many years. “We see helicopters flying above we see state police out and about we have the national guard on the streets it is an absolutely breathtaking scene. “There has been nothing quite like this perhaps since 9/11 to see this type of police presence.” . Adrian Lancashire, euronews: . “What are you hearing about the suspects’ origins and possible motivations? Two young Chechens in the US, and described as “armed and dangerous?”” . Tahman Bradley, abc news: . “These brothers were heavily armed they were firing explosives at law enforcement officers they were shooting guns there was a shoot out, one of the suspects was killed, the other one got away and law enforcement are continuing the man hunt for them we are trying to find out more information about them. “President Obama and his administration are looking into their backgrounds they’re trying to find out if they have any ties to international terrorism right now that information is still not known.” . Adrian Lancashire, euronews: . “Your president said after the attack on the race: “We’re going to find out who did this, and why.” Why they did this? That’s surely not looking for any justification, but a cause, right? . Tahman Bradley, abc news: . “It was unusual Adrian because right after the attack no-one claimed responsibility. Usually when we have an act of terror like this someone comes out and says this is my work this is my job. “Apparently these two individuals did not do it and law enforcement here in fact used the public to help them to locate them. “They put out surveillance images that were captured of the two individuals that information was made public late last night, and then they were in pursuit of these individuals just a couple of hours later.” . Adrian Lancashire, euronews: . “Tahman Bradley in Boston, thanks for bringing us up to the minute on the tensions there.” .
