# ORIG TITLE    Tina Maze claims Alpine World Cup title . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Tina Maze was head over heels with joy after being crowned the new queen of Alpine Skiing on Sunday. The Slovenian claims the overall World Cup title after winning the womenâ€™s super combined event in Meribel, France. The 29-year-old achieves her lifetime goal, with nine World Cup events still to go. Maze is now an unbeatable 958 points ahead, as each competition only gives 100 points for victory. Currently on 1,844 points, she is set to become the first woman to break through the 2,000 points barrier, something she could do as early as next week at the German resort of Garmisch-Partenkirchen. Her victory was sealed when reigning world champion, Maria Hoefl-Riesch, the only skier still in a position to catch her, crashed out of the competition towards the end of her slalom run. Austrians Nicole Hosp and Michaela Kirchgasser finished second and third respectively in Meribel, 0.82 and 0.90 seconds behind.
