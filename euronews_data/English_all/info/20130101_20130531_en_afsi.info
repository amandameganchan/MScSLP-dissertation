# ORIG TITLE    Bangladesh miracle survivor speaks . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Rescue workers had given up hope of finding anyone else alive in the rubble of the Rana Plaza, except Reshma Begum. The moment of rescue was tense, emergency crews drilled, crowds cheered, others prayed. The nightmare had begun 17 days ago for the young seamstress as she went to work on the second floor of the factory building on the outskirts of the capital Dhaka, in Bangladesh. Little did she know that in days to come she would be scavenging for biscuits in the rucksacks of dead colleagues. From her hospital bed Reshma Begum told reporters: “I did not have anything to eat, I only had two bottles of water with me. I got a stick to show them I am alive here but no one could hear me.” . It was 408 hours later that rescue worker Mohammad Rubel Rana did hear the cries of Reshma. He described the moment he found her: . “When I was cutting iron rods, suddenly I found a silver coloured stick just moving from a hole, and I looked through and I saw someone calling ‘please save me”. The official death toll now stands at one thousand and fifty people. Nine people have been arrested in connection with the collapse of the building including the owner.
