# ORIG TITLE    Thatcher’s funeral set for April 17 . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The funeral of Margaret Thatcher will be held next week on Wednesday April 17. There have been some calls for Lady Thatcher to be given a state funeral but 10 Downing Street says she will have a ceremony with full military honours, which is one rung down from a state funeral. It will take place at London’s St Paul’s Cathedral following a procession from Westminster. The details were agreed at a “coordination meeting” between the Thatcher family and Buckingham Palace because the Queen’s consent was required. Britain’s longest serving and first and only female prime minister died on Monday after suffering a stroke while staying at the Ritz hotel in London. She was 87. Lady Thatcher had been resident at the hotel since being discharged from hospital at the end of last year.
