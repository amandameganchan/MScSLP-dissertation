# ORIG TITLE    Italy: search underway for missing US F-16 fighter jet . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Italy’s coast guard service has been looking for a missing F-16 US fighter jet off the country’s Adriatic coast. Italian and US aircraft are also involved in the search for the jet and its pilot, believed to have been the only person aboard. Air traffic control lost contact with the F-16 on Monday evening, but fog and darkness hampered the search overnight. The US military says the plane took off from Italy’s Aviano air base and was performing a training mission over the Adriatic Sea. Italian media has reported that a fishing boat picked up some pieces of debris that could be parts of a US airforce plane.
