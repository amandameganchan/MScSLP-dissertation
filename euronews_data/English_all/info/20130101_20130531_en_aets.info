# ORIG TITLE    Boston capture of Marathon bomber . 
# ORIG CONTENT  After four days of living in fear, the people of Boston expressed their relief as the second suspect of the marathon bombings was driven away, bleeding, in an ambulance on Friday night. The community in Watertown has been at the centre of an unprecedented manhunt for 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. He is suspected, along with his brother, of being responsible for setting off two bombs on at the Boston marathon on Monday that killed three people and left 176 injured. Then days later they fatally shot a police officer at MIT campus as they tried to flee. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev’s brother, Tamerlan, was killed in a shootout with police on Thursday night, but he managed to flee the scene despite being wounded. This put the whole of Boston, and the surrounding towns, on lock-down, as tactical units conducted systematic house-to-house searches of the neighbourhood. He was eventually discovered by a resident of Watertown who had seen blood on the boat in his backyard and found a wounded Dzhokhar hiding inside. As the hunt drew to a close and after information about the suspects’ foreign links came to light, US President Barack Obama warned Americans not to use the actions of individuals to fuel their own prejudices: . “In this age of instant reporting, tweets and blogs there is a temptation to latch on to any bit of information, sometimes to jump to conclusions,” he said. “That is why we relentlessly gather the facts, that is why we have courts, that is why we take care not to rush to judgements, not about the motivations of these individuals, certainly not about entire groups of people.” . After being stuck indoors for hours a carnival atmosphere erupted on the streets. Residents gave thanks to the hundreds of officers who had been involved in the search. For them the capture and killing of the two suspects means that life can return to normal. But unable to join in the celebrations there are still many of the bombers’ victims who remain, with life changing injuries, in hospital.
