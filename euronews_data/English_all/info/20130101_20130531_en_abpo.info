# ORIG CONTENT  The leader of one of Tunisia’s main opposition parties has been shot and killed outside his home. Reports claim Chokri Belaïd was hit in the head and chest four times as he left his home in the capital Tunis for work. Belaïd was a member of the left-leaning Democratic Patriots party, part of leftist Popular Front coalition. The Popular Front is the main political opponent of the government dominated by the Islamist Ennahda party. Over the weekend, Belaïd accused Ennhada hired ‘mercenaries’ of disrupting a Democratic Patriots meeting.
