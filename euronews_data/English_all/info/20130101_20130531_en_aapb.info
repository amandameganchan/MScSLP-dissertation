# ORIG TITLE    Eighty killed in Aleppo University blasts . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Officials and activists in Syria say more than 80 people have been killed in two devastating explosions at Aleppo University. Reports suggest more than 160 others were wounded. The blasts, at one of Syria’s largest universities, were clearly timed to cause maximum chaos as they coincided with the first day of exams. The campus lies in the government-controlled area. State television said there had been one explosion at the halls of residence. A second blast is reported to have been caused by a nearby burning car. The official Syrian news agency blamed “terrorists” for the blasts. But activists say that the campus buildings were hit by missiles fired by the military. Aleppo, Syria’s commercial centre, has largely been under siege since last July. After nearly two years of fighting, rebels have so-far been thwarted in their attempts take the city by better-armed government forces.
