# ORIG TITLE    Tube-train tango provides fun for Kiev pensioners . 
# ORIG CONTENT  In Kiev, a group of senior citizens have found a form of underground entertainment that has sparked their own kind of Saturday Night Fever. With no funds to hire a dance hall for socialising, Kiev’s mayor stepped in and gave them a venue with a difference. For the last 20 years or so they have had a unique platform to show off their dance moves. It is a subway, where every Saturday night around 200 pensioners in traditional Ukrainian costume can dance and share memories of past times. They have become well-known in Kiev, and amongst each other. Natalya Stolyarchuk and Mykola Milevsky are just one couple who became an item doing the ‘Kiev Quickstep.’ . She explained that she was sad and bored so she went once to dance. Towards the end, she said, Mykola asked her to dance. They liked the look of each other, and fell in love at first sight. They have been together ever since, she said.   And he added, they have everything in common.
