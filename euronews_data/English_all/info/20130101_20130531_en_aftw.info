# ORIG TITLE    “Rubygate” prosecutors want Berlusconi banned from public office . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Prosecutors in the ‘Rubygate’ scandal are demanding a six-year prison sentence for Italy’s former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi. They also want Berlusconi banned from public office for life. The Milan trial is to deal with accusations the ex-prime minister had sex with with an underage girl in 2010. “The prosecutor is doing the right thing by pushing forward with the proceedings. Whoever deserves to be sentenced must be sentenced and go to jail. We are fed up. I’m from Milan and almost 90 years old. I’ve never seen such dirty tricks being played against judges. Not even during the fascist era under Il Duce, Mussolini,” said Milan resident Giuseppe Recalcati. Berlusconi is charged with paying a 17-year-old “Ruby the Heartstealer” for sex at one of the infamous “bunga-bunga” parties. Ruby’s real name is Karima El-Mahroug. Both she and Berlusconi deny the allegations. The former prime minister recently lost an appeal to overturn his conviction for tax fraud and four-year prison sentence. The verdict is expected on June 24.
