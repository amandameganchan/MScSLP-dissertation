# ORIG TITLE    Fenninger wins in Germany . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Austria’s Anna Fenninger kept her composure to win a World Cup giant slalom in Ofterschwang on Saturday. The 23 year old, winner of a super-G in Garmisch-Partenkirchen a week ago, looked in great shape and completed the Ofterschwanger Horn course in an impressive time of 2 minutes, 29.39 seconds to secure the win. Fastest in the morning leg, Fenninger edged out overall leader Tina Maze who will be aiming at the formidable 2,500-point barrier in the World Cup finals in Switzerland, next week. Germany’s Viktoria Rebensburg produced a solid run but eventually had to settle for third place, 0.96 behind.
