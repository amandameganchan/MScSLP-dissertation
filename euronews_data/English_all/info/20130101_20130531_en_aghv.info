# ORIG TITLE    IMF chief Christine Lagarde escapes formal investigation . 
# ORIG CONTENT  French magistrates decided on Friday not to place IMF chief Christine Lagarde under formal investigation over her role in a 285 million euros arbitration payment made to a supporter of former president Nicolas Sarkozy. Lagarde was instead given the status of a “supervised witness”, after she was questioned on her 2008 decision as Sarkozy’s finance minister to use arbitration to settle a court battle between the state and businessman Bernard Tapie. “My explanations answered questions raised about the decisions that I had made at the time,” Lagarde told reporters outside the Paris court. “My status as a supervised witness is not a surprise for me because I always acted in the interest of the state and according to the law.” .
