# ORIG CONTENT  David Moyes has been appointed the new manager of Manchester United after agreeing a six-year contract with the English Premier league champions starting July 1. Moyes, who had been coach of Everton for 11 years, has some very big shoes to fill as he replaces arguably football’s greatest manager – 71-year-old Sir Alex Ferguson. Despite not winning any silverware with the Toffees, 50-year-old Moyes has gained the respect of the Old Trafford hierarchy for punching above his former club’s financial weight with consistent top-ten finishes in the Premier League. Ferguson – who considered appointing Moyes as his assistant when in charge at Preston North End and has had a close relationship with his successor throughout his managerial career – announced on Wednesday his retirement after almost 27 years in charge of the Red Devils, during which time he won a total of 38 trophies.
