# ORIG TITLE    Bahrain GP struggles again with image . 
# ORIG CONTENT  This weekend’s Bahrain Grand Prix will once again take place against a backdrop of political termoil. The Gulf island kingdom has experienced anti-government protesting and rioting on an almost daily basis for more than two years. But for the CEO of the Bahrain international circuit it’s business as usual in the build up to the fourth stop of the 2013 calendar. Sheikh Salman Bin Isa Al Khalifa said: “We are in our final days of preparation for this big event. The team of Bahrain International Circuit are putting the final touches to the Formula One village and to the entertainment program.” . Around the circuit all looks calm and peaceful – a country ready for the formula one circus to come to town. But look closer and signs of discontent are clear for all to see with graffiti sprayed across the walls asks for a ‘‘Boycott of Formula One’‘. A sentiment shared by many who believe the race should be cancelled, as it was in 2011. After a series of recent explosions and clashes in the Gulf nation’s financial district this season’s race, like that of 2012, will go ahead but against the backdrop of heightened security and ongoing political tension.
