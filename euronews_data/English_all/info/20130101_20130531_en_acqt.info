# ORIG TITLE    Svindal wins super-G title with maiden home snow victory . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Norway’s Aksel Lund Svindal celebrated a double whammy on Sunday when he finally won a race on home snow with victory in a super-G that also handed him the World Cup title in the discipline. The two-time overall world cup champion had reached the lower podium steps seven times before in front of his home fans on the 1994 Olympic course in Kvitfjell. But he finally came good on Sunday and secured his ninth career World Cup trophy with a time of one minute 29.79 seconds. The win also lifted the super-G Olympic champion to within 29 points of overall World Cup leader Marcel Hirscher with seven races left this season. Austrian super-G specialist Georg Streitberger was second. The 31-year-old was denied his third career super-G victory by just over five tenths of a second. It was his second runner’s up finish of this campaign after a second place showing in the downhill in Garmisch-Partenkirchen last month. Italian Werner Heel was third. The 30-year-old 12-season veteran was a further five hundredths of a second adrift for his second third place finish of the season. His first and only other podium placing this term came on home snow in December’s super-G race in Val Gardena.
