# ORIG TITLE    Pakistan court orders arrest of prime minister . 
# ORIG CONTENT  There’s been a mixed reaction to the Pakistani Supreme Court’s decision to order the arrest of the prime minister over a corruption inquiry. Raja Pervez Ashraf is wanted in connection with a case linked to power projects, plunging the country into fresh political turmoil. The government is already under pressure from a growing protest led by a cleric with strong ties to the army, raising fears among some that the military is plotting to force out a civilian leader. Even if Ashraf is ousted, the ruling coalition led by the Pakistan Peoples’ Party (PPP) has a majority in parliament and lawmakers can simply elect another prime minister.
