# ORIG TITLE    Bali death sentence for UK grandma . 
# ORIG CONTENT  British grandmother, Lindsay Sandiford has been sentenced to death in Bali for drug smuggling. She was arrested last May after Indonesian customs discovered 4.8kg of cocaine lining her suitcase. Indonesia has some of the toughest anti-drug laws in the world, with around 40 foreigners currently on death row for drugs related offences. The news has shocked many as the prosecution recommended a jail sentence of 15 years. The judges said that Sandiford had damaged Bali’s image and weakened the government’s anti-drug programme. The verdict has increased tension between Indonesia and the UK which has reiterated its opposition to the death penalty. Sandiford insists she was coerced into carrying the drugs to protect her children. Her lawyer has said they will appeal, but the process could take up to 8 years.
