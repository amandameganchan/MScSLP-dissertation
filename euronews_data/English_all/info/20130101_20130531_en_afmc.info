# ORIG CONTENT  Tens of thousands of far-left protesters have marched through Paris, to vent their anger over economic austerity. Sunday’s demonstration came on the eve of the first anniversary of Francois Hollande’s election as French President. The crowd were fired up by far-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon. “We don’t want the financial sector in power,” he told the crowds. “We do not accept austerity policies that usher in endless suffering for our people, like all others in Europe.” . Although not huge, the protest highlighted fierce opposition on the left to the Socialist president’s market-friendly reforms.- and the loosening of labour rules which makes hiring and firing slightly easier. “A number of economists, whose thoughts are well regarded, have recently said that this policy of austerity is driving us into the wall. The people of the world are getting poorer and poorer,” said one demonstrator. France is on the edge of recession and unemployment is at an all time high. Hollande has suffered the sharpest fall in popularity of any president in more than half a century.
