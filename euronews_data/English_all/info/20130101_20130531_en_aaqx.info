# ORIG TITLE    Tough new gun laws for New York . 
# ORIG CONTENT  In Kentucky, USA, two people have been shot in a car park of a college. The killings came a day before President Barack Obama is expected to unveil wide-ranging plans aimed at curbing gun violence. His proposals could echo measures which New York state voted on Tuesday to introduce. They are considered the toughest in the country and include a wider ban on assault weapons. “Let’s stop glorifying violence, guns and those who use them. All I hear today is ‘We need to have these weapons to defend ourselves.’ Well, we are not going to be invaded by an army,” said Thomas Abinanti a New York State Assembly member . The National Rifle Association, the nation’s top gun lobby, has released a new app on iTunes. It is recommended for 12-year-olds and upwards and features a 3D shooting range using coffins for target practice. The lobby group has said it will contest any attempts to limit access to guns or ammunition. It’s understood President Obama is considering 19 specific measures on gun control. He will announce his plans in the White House flanked by children who wrote to him after the shootings in Newtown last month in which 27 people were killed.
