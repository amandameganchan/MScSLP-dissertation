# ORIG TITLE    Top Portuguese minister resigns over university allegations . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A senior member of Portugal’s cabinet, Miguel Relvas, has resigned amid claims that he got his university degree without completing the necessary work. Relvas was minister for parliamentary affairs and was close to the prime minister. The Education Department has been investigating the claims and is due to publish its findings. It could be that Relvas’ degree in political science might be revoked. He stepped down just a day after the conservative government survived a no-confidence vote in Portugal’s parliament. The resignation has heightened a sense of unease around the administration which has to force through even more already unpopular austerity measures. Belt-tightening measures to meet EU and IMF financial bailout conditions are facing possible rejection by the Constitutional Court.
