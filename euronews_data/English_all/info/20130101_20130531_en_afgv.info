# ORIG CONTENT  One member of the Afghan border police is dead and two Pakistani soldiers have been wounded after a row close to the disputed Gursal border gate. A two-hour firefight began after an attack on a Pakistani checkpoint, according to officials in Islamabad. The Pakistani Foreign Ministry released a statement saying it had summoned the senior Afghan diplomat in Islamabad to protest at what it called “an unprovoked firing incident.” . However, Kabul is claiming Pakistani troops were in the wrong when they tried to fortify the gate on the Afghan side. Afghan Foreign Ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqi said the situation at the border was now “under control.” . The border is over 2,600 kilometres long, and militants often cross over, carrying out attacks in both countries. The US is trying to improve relations between the two countries before NATO troops leaving Afghanistan at the end of 2014. America wants Pakistan to help Afghanistan to coax the Taliban to the negotiating table ahead of the withdrawal.
