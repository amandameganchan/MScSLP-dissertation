# ORIG CONTENT  The Philippines’ Foreign Affairs department has confirmed that one of its nationals was wounded  while escaping with a Japanese colleague before the siege at the gas complex in Algeria started. Another Filipino who was among workers who were evacuated was also wounded.   The Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, having cancelled a foreign trip, gave his reaction to events in Algeria.   “I’ve strongly asked Algeria to deal with the situation by giving priority to human lives and to ensuring people’s safety. I believe the leaders of the other countries convey the same message,” he said.   Ther were similar thoughts from the Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eid. “Algeria has not had assistance from other nations, as far as I know. I certainly know about countries which have offered to give Algeria assistance, but that has been declined. Therefore it is very likely that this is an Algerian operation,” he said.    British Prime Minister David Cameron in his statement to the UK parliament warned of a wider threat from al Qaeda.    “What we know is that the terrorist threat in the Sahel comes from al Qaeda in Islamic Magreb. They aspire to establish Islamic law across the Sahel and northern Africa and they also aspire to attack western interests in the region and frankly wherever they can. Just as we have reduced the scale of the al Qaeda threat in other parts of the world, including in Pakistan and Afghanistan, so the threat has grown in other parts of the world,” he said.   Cameron added he was “disappointed” Algeria did not tell him in advance of the rescue attempt.
