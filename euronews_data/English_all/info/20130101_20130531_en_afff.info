# ORIG TITLE    Spain’s El Celler de Can Roca named best restaurant . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The Roca brothers in Spain have been celebrating ever since their restaurant El Celler de Can Roca was named the world’s best. Edging Denmark’s Norma restaurant into second place despite it having held the top ranking for the last three years, the Spanish establishment has long been hailed as one of the country’s most exiting places to eat. The top fifty list of restaurants has been published annually since 2002 and is compiled from votes cast by 900 international leaders in the restaurant industry… tasty work for some. Top three places went to: Spain’s El Celler de Can Roca. Denmark’s Norma Italy’s Osteria Francescana. Britain’s London’s Dinner by Heston Blumenthal came seventh.
