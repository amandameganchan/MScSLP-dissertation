# ORIG TITLE    Milan fashion plays safe . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Milan Men’s Fashion Week has been notable for sticking to the conventions as designers showed safe classics in an effort to boost flagging sales. Kean Etro unveiled his winter menswear collection drawing inspiration from nature and using a colour palette from the forest with olive bark and herringbone patterns. The Emporio Armani menswear collection was, as always, well-received. Iconic styles were revisited in high-tech materials. The colour palette featured eternal blue and asphalt grey. The Missoni show went on despite the disappearance of CEO Vittorio Missoni and five others in a small plane over South America more than a week ago. As rescue crews continue to search for the missing plane, the design house showed a collection inspired by the American West to a suitably mournful soundtrack. The Gucci collection was more colourful and upbeat, in shades of yellow, sky blue and rich burgundy. It also featured a range of luxurious men’s handbags.
