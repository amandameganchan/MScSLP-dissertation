# ORIG CONTENT  Defeated opposition presidential candidate Henrique Capriles has demanded a recount and rejected the election of Nicolas Maduro calling it “illegitimate”. The 40-year-old governor of Miranda state took 49.1 percent of the ballot confounding most forecasts. One political analyst said the unpredictable narrow margin has proven how volatile the political scenario is. A protracted election dispute could lead to instability. He claimed his team had a list of more than 3,000 ballot irregularities which included gunshots and the illegal re-opening of polling stations. The five-member election board said the result was “irreversible”. Critics claim four of its members are openly pro-government.
