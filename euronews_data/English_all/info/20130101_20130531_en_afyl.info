# ORIG CONTENT  Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan is due to meet Barack Obama later on May 16. The talks come just days after deadly car bomb attacks in the Turkish border town of Reyhanli on May 11, which Ankara said were carried out by Syrian security forces. Damascus denied it was involved. Ahead of his White House visit, Erdogan visited Maryland to open a Turkish-American Community Centre on May 15. Erdogan stressed the importance of improving the image of Islam. “There is a trend of Islamophopia at the moment – this is wrong and based on misconceptions. We would like to promote the friendship of Islam and to show why Islamophobia is so wrong,” he said. Turkey has become home to some 400,000 refugees from the conflict in Syria. Ankara and Washington share the view that Syrian President Bashar al Assad should be ousted.
