# ORIG TITLE    Mixed reactions from Venezuela to death of Chavez . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Outside the Caracas military hospital where he died, supporters of Venezuela’s president Hugo Chavez gathered to mourn their leader. “My heart is broken, Chavez took a piece of my heart,“said Beatriz Ramos. “Our commander-in chief is an irreparable loss. He was a heroic man that fought for Venezuela, especially for us – the poor,” added Armando Gonzalez. Chavez was a divisive figure and not all Venezuelans are as grief stricken. Some are shocked at how quickly a leader who was said to be running the country passed away. Teofrank Rojas said he feels the government did not tell the truth about the dead president’s condition. “I don’t know whether to categorise it as a lie, but they said they talked with him (Chavez), they had conversations, they had work meetings and in 48-72 hours this happened (Chavez’s death),” Rojas explained. There are also those who did not like Chavez, but are willing to admit his death is a big deal. “I think the best future for Venezuela is without Chavez, but he does leave a legacy. I don’t share his ideas, but he does leave behind positive things for the country,” said Julio Pastor.
