# ORIG CONTENT  Security is watertight in the Vatican City for the papal conclave, with sniffer dogs deployed to search for hidden bombs. Because there are not enough dogs to go round, sophisticated and expensive explosives detectors have been bought to allow the hundreds of deployed police to cover every square centimetre. “This is nothing more than a device which extracts suspect particles from the air and tells us if there are any explosives around,” explained one police inspector. All the extra tourists and faithful flocking to St. Peter’s have to troop through metal detectors, the pilgrim’s progress monitored by a host of CCTV cameras. No-one is immune from identity checks; not even our man on the scene. “There will be hundreds of thousands of pilgrims checked by hundreds of police officers, deployed until the end of the conclave when the world will discover who the next pope will be,” says euronews’ Alberto DeFilippis.
