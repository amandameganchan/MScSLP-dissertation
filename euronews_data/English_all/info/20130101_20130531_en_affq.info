# ORIG TITLE    Bangladesh: factory victims buried, EU threatens sanctions . 
# ORIG CONTENT  In the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka, volunteers buried 18 unidentified factory workers – victims of the country’s worst-ever industrial disaster. At least 400 people were killed when the Rana Plaza, which housed a textile factory, collapsed last week. Thousands of people took part in a May Day demonstration in central Dhaka, protesting against poor safety standards and low wages. At the rally, union leader Nazma Akhtar said: “We demand wages to earn our livelihood. With the wages they give us it is very difficult to live. On May Day, we also demand full compensation from the factory owners who are killing the workers.” . The European Union has told Bangladesh to ‘act immediately’ to improve safety standards, saying the country risks trade sanctions if it does not take action. Bangladesh currently has duty-free access to EU markets for its garments.
