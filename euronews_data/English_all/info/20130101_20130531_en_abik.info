# ORIG TITLE    Making algebra fun – meet the Maths Rapper . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Do you have problems memorising mathematical formulae or just hate the subject ? German maths genius Johann Beurich might have the answer. He fuses Rap and maths and produces his videos all by himself. “I really like making music and made a lot of music in my free time. I always wanted to write my own songs, but I didn’t have ideas for texts. So I took the maths,” he says. All of a sudden: mathematical formulas sound so easy! . His songs are even used in maths classes at school. Many pupils finally have a helpful catchy song that makes things clear. Even girls who sometimes do not fancy maths very much like this new formula: Maths + Rap= Fun . “Whenever I needed the formula I instantly thought of the melody of the song so I did not have to learn the formula by heart,” says student Odin Seidler. Teachers also like the math raps. This pupil shows that maths can be cool and that it is possible to identify with maths. He shows that maths can be vivid and easy to understand,” says teacher Undine Pabst. Meanwhile Johan has finished school and started university and aims to simplify the complicated maths at university with his songs. Linear functions, Pythagoras or binomial formulas go into the mix and emerge as catchy study aids. Just watch the videos of German maths genius and rapper Johann Beurich on the internet – proof that making the numbers add up can be cool.
