# ORIG TITLE    Battle for Qusair inflicts heavy losses in Syria . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Fierce fighting for the Syrian rebel stronghold of Qusair has inflicted heavy losses on all parties including Lebanese militants Hezbollah. The battle for strategically important Qusair is a possible turning point in the war â€“ a win for the regime would restore links between Damascus and the Mediterranean coast. While the latest amateur video is said to show rebels fighting street by street, Hezbollah is thought to have lost at least 30 fighters with 70 more wounded as they back the Syrian regime. If confirmed it is the largest toll for the Lebanese militants in a single Syrian operation. The conflict is rapidly raising regional tensions with propaganda being used on all sides. Jeeps found in Qusair city centre are claimed by Syrian television to be Israeli although they may have been brought by Hezbollah. As the fighting rages Western countries and Russia, an ally of Damascus, continue to back opposing sides. Meanwhile the spokesman for the special UN Syrian peace envoy has returned to Damascus. Mokhtar Lamani said all efforts will now focus on the US and Russian-sponsored peace conference on Syria planned for next month.
