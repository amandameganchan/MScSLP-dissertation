# ORIG CONTENT  Opposition parties in Ukraine have blocked parliament in protest, paralysing the legislature since February 5. They accuse the ruling Party of Regions of unfair proxy voting for absent colleagues, which is done via a button system. The Party of Regions says any change to the system should be addressed with dialogue not protest. “To solve this issue, let’s sit down, analyse the situation together with experts and make a decision,” said Oleksandr Yefremov of the Party of Regions. Former boxing champion Vitaliy Klychko, who heads up the liberal “UDAR” party, disagrees: . “There is no will to solve this issue. They want to keep pushing all these buttons at the same time, like playing the piano,” Klychko said. “UDAR” and other opposition groups say all members of parliament should show up to vote in person. The deadlock shows how difficult it could be for President Victor Yanukovich and his Party of Regions to pass laws ahead of 2015 elections if a resolution is not found.
