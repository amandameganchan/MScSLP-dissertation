# ORIG TITLE    Cannes: thefts, comebacks and lesbian love scenes . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Cannes has become a victim to its glamour once again, as a second suspected jewellery theft of a diamond necklace worth almost 2 million euros was reported on Thursday. Despite heavy security, it disappeared from a hotel during a star-studded event, according to jeweller De Grisogono. Lightening up the red carpet, actor Jerry Lewis made his comeback at the premiere for his latest film in 18 years ‘Max Rose’, but he couldn’t steal all the media attention. “With the prize ceremony just three days away, nominees are jostling for the Palme d’Or. Alexander Payne’s film ‘Nebraska’ strikes a chord showing the American mid west in a light rarely seen on the big screen. Whilst Abdelattif Kechiche offers up a lesbian love story in ‘La Vie d’Adèle’ which is troubling and often raw.” . It is Payne’s second attempt at the Palme d’Or, after ‘About Schmidt’ competed for the top prize in 2002. Shot in black and white, ‘Nebraska’ starring Bruce Dern and Will Forte, is a melancholic tale of a father-son road trip. So far it has received mixed reviews from the critics. One of the most talked about films in competition is ‘La Vie d’Adele, Chapitre 1 et 2’ starring Léa Seydoux and Adèle Exarchopoulos. It has premiered to rave reviews despite raising eyebrows over explicit love scenes and a running time which could limit its release. It is the first film entered by French-Tunisian director Abdellatif Kechiche at Cannes. Answering journalists, he said it was not his intention to make a film about gay rights, but merely to depict beauty in the love scenes.
