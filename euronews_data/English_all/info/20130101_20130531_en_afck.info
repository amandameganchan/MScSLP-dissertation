# ORIG CONTENT  Anti-War protesters have been demonstrating outside a British air base which is being used as a control point for drones used in Afghanistan. All British drones had previously been operated from a US Airforce base in Nevada, but there is now a new drone operating squadron at Royal Air Force Station Waddington in Lincolnshire. One anti-war protester said: . “We don’t feel that our government should be killing people thousands of miles away and without trial, without conviction.” . Another added: . “It is a very, very wicked thing to do. We must not condone it, and a lot of our people do not know that we are doing this, in fact.” . The British Ministry of Defence said the Reaper Drones are used for “intelligence and surveillance” missions, but they are equipped with missiles and bombs. Though piloted remotely from the UK, the drones are launched and landed with human help at Kandahar airbase in Afghanistan. The ministry says the operators follow the same strict rules of engagement as other RAF pilots.
