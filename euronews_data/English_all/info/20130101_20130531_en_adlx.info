# ORIG TITLE    West Bank press conference: Obama seeks two-state solution . 
# ORIG CONTENT  US President Barack Obama and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas have held a press conference in Ramallah as Obama visits the West Bank. It coincides with Abbas condemning the actions of Palestinian militants who fired rockets into southern Israel on Thursday morning. During the press conference, Obama said he had spoken to Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu about Israeli settlements in the West Bank and achieving a peaceful two state solution. On Wednesday, Obama made his first trip to Israel as US president. “We seek an independent, viable and contiguous Palestinian state as a homeland for Palestinian people. Along side the Jewish state of Israel, two nations enjoying self-determination, security and peace,” Obama told reporters in Ramallah. Abbas thanked Obama for making the visit, before stressing the need to end what he referred to as “occupation”. Abbas added: “We are here to say once again that we are ready to implement our commitments and decisions; and to respect the international agreements and resolutions meant to build the peace process; and to achieve a peaceful solution for our two states, Palestine and Israel.” . However, Palestinians who say they are tired of the America’s bias towards Israel staged a protest in Ramallah. The demonstration is not against Obama’s visit, but directed at US policy, according to protesters.
