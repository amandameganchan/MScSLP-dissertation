# ORIG TITLE    EU’s “lost generation” to be heard at polls . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The latest market research suggests Europe’s politicians should beware the youth vote in next year’s EU parliamentary poll. Expect a close contest next May says the study from Debating Europe, mainly thanks to the young. Polls say they will vote as never before, and more first-time voters are motivated, too, leading some to suggest the youth vote will double. Bearing in mind Europe’s young are currently among the worst-hit during this long economic crisis, it will be interesting to see how they will express themselves, and for whom, next May.
