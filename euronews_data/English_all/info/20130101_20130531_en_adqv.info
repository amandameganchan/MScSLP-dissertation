# ORIG TITLE    Americans for and against gay marriage have their day in court . 
# ORIG CONTENT  At a Wedding March on Washington pro and anti-gay marriage protestors faced off outside the US Supreme Court. It marked day one of a hearing on Proposition 8 which forbids same-sex couples in California from tying the knot. The justices are examining the constitutionality of such a ban. Outside the building, people speculated on the outcome. One woman said the verdict could go either way. Another member of the crowd felt the moment would find its place in the history books: “We believe that these justices see the way this issue is moving, the pace of history right now is incredible with this momentum. They just need to decide what side of history they want to stand on,” he said. Though nine states have already legalised same-sex marriage, Ryan Anderson from the right-wing think-tank Heritage Foundation defends the idea of marriage as exclusively heterosexual. “We believe that marriage is between a man and a woman, coming together as husband and wife to be mother and father to any children that the union produces. This is based on the biological fact that it takes a man and a woman to produce a child.” . The court’s verdict is expected in June and hopes are high for a conclusive verdict. However, by the end of the first day the US justices appeared wary to commit to a ruling either way. Euronews correspondant Stefan Grobe in Washington says: . “There has been a dramatic shift in public opinion in favour of gay marriages. And politicians from Hillary Clinton to leading Republicans have recently declared their support as well. It is now up to the justices to impede or strengthen the winds of change.” .
