# ORIG CONTENT  Large crowds gathered in Caracas to watch the inauguration of the new interim President of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro. Despite the celebrations, the thoughts of those attending were still very much focused on Hugo Chavez with his legacy set to live on in a large part of the population of the country. “This is not the end. He is alive and will live until the seas dry up.He will continue to be a part of the lives of his people, and their children and their grandchildren,” said one supporter. Nicolas Maduro entered the National Assembly as the Vice-President and left as the interim President of Venezuela. “Chavistas” believe the move is completely legitimate and are prepared to defend the constitution and revolution.
