# ORIG TITLE    Ex-PP money man quizzed in Spain’s slush-fund inquiry . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The former treasurer of Spain’s ruling Popular Party has been grilled by prosecutors over an alleged bribery scandal that has even thrown suspicion on the prime minister. Luis Barcenas was formally questionned over claims that party leaders, including premier Mariano Rajoy, received secret payments from company bosses. Jorge Trias also went. He is a former congressman for the PP itself, who has already claimed he knew about what he called “envelopes of money” going to party leaders. And in another sign of internal party tension, the local leader in Madrid, Esperanza Aguirre, said she wanted quicker action. “The judge will question Barcenas on February 25. That seems very late to me,” she said, “how will that affect public opinion?” . Prime Minister Rajoy and other senior members of the party have denied any wrongdoing after the newspaper El Pais published what it claimed were handwritten ledgers covering nearly two decades of secret payments. Barcenas, has also denied the allegations against him, claiming the documents were faked, and saying it was not his handwriting. But last weekend the calls for Rajoy to resign grew louder.
