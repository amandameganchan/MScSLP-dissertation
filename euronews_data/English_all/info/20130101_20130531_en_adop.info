# ORIG TITLE    Vettel ignores team orders to win in Malaysia . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Defending champion Sebastian Vettel held his nerve to edge out team-mate Mark Webber and win a controversial Malaysian Grand Prix in Sepang on Sunday. Webber had produced a superb display to climb into the lead and was told by his Red Bull team to ease off in the closing stages. Vettel took the opportunity to edge past the Australian and claim his 27th race win. Britainâ€™s Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg finished third and fourth respectively and this win sees Vettel stretch his lead atop the overall standings. The 25 year old now leads Kimi Raikkonen by nine points going into the third race of the season in Shanghai on April 14.
