# ORIG CONTENT  The death toll from the collapse of a factory in Bangladesh has climbed to over 1,000. It is believed that more bodies might still be trapped two weeks after the Rana Plaza complex accident occurred. The disaster near the capital Dhaka is said to have been triggered when generators were started up during a blackout. Focus has been placed on Western retailers who use the impoverished country as a source of cheap goods. The garment industry worth almost €15 billion accounts for 80% of the South Asian country’s exports. The Bangladeshi government has blamed the owners and builders of the eight story complex for using shoddy materials. The European Union has threatened punitive measures in order to press Dhaka to improve safety standards for the 4 million people who work in the industry.
