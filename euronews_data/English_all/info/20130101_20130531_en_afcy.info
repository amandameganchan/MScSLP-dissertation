# ORIG CONTENT  Five men have been convicted by an EU-led court in Kosovo for organ trafficking. Urologist Lutfi Dervishi and his son Arban, were sentenced to eight and seven years respectively, whilst the remaining three received between one and three years imprisonment. Two were acquitted, including the former health minister and two other accused remain at large. “Although there remain many hurdles to overcome to bring satisfactory justice to the vulnerable victims in this case, such as compensation and international arrest of outstanding suspects. Let’s hope that today’s verdict and judgment will be viewed as bringing justice and security to the victims in this matter,” explained EU special prosecutor in Kosovo, Jonathan Ratel. Over 23 illegal kidney transplants were performed at the Medicus clinic in the capital Pristina in 2008. The centre was closed down following the scandal. The ring was exposed when a Turkish man was stopped at the airport visibly in pain after having his kidney removed.
