# ORIG TITLE    Judo Grand Slam Baku: Day one . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A week after securing bronze at the European Judo Championships in Budapest Ebru Sahin of Turkey went two medals better to win gold in the under 48 kilo category on day one of the Judo Grand Slam in Baku, Azerbaijan. Baku is the second of four marquee Grand Slam events this year and Sahin sounded the warning bells to her rivals for the rest of the season after beating Otgontsetseg Galbadrakh of Mongolia by ippon. There was success for Mongolia over in the men’s competition as Samsun Grand Prix winner Amartuvshin Dashdavaa underlined his top seed status by winning the -60kg class. Dashdavaa recovered from a sluggish start to beat Askhat Telmanov of Kazakhstan. Despite falling behind early in the combat Dasdavaa hit back with two waza-aris to capture the gold medal by ippon. Britain’s Ashley McKenzie just missed out on a place on the podium losing his bronze-medal match.
