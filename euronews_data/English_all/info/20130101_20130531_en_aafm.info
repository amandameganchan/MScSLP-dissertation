# ORIG TITLE    The best of Berlinâ€™s graffiti . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The German capital is a magnet for street artists. They were drawn to the city when it was divided and the Western side of the Berlin Wall became a huge mural and messageboard for artists from around the world. After the fall of the wall the vast open spaces of East Berlin were seen as an empty canvas. This is now a tourist attraction in its own right and each year thousands of people take part in the alternative street art tour of Berlin.
