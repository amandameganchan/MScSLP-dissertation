# ORIG TITLE    Red Cross, EU launch ‘Silent Disasters’ campaign . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has launched a campaign to draw more attention to what it calls ‘Silent Disasters’.   The organisation will broadcast a short film in 11 EU countries to highlight under-reported humanitarian crises.   It is backed by the EU Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid Kristalina Georgieva.   “Why it is important for these Silent Disasters to speak up because more people in more areas are affected by them and this stabilises local communities,” Georgieva said.   “For solidarity to work for all, we have to make the voices of people who are now in Silent Disasters heard.”   The campaign follows a series of Red Cross-backed documentaries by euronews journalist Chris Cummins, which covered Haiti’s post-quake recovery and the plight of Aborigines in Australia.   Red Cross research has found that 91 percent of the disasters they respond to often go unnoticed and can fail to attract the essential funds needed.
