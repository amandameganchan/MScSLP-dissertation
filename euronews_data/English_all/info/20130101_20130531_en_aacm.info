# ORIG CONTENT  Thousands of homes on France’s Reunion island remain without power after being hit by Indian Ocean Cyclone Dumile. Meteorologists say the worst is now probably over but people have been urged to stay indoors with torrential rains continuing and strong winds gusting near 200 km/h. There have been no reports of any serious injuries, but many roads, air and shipping lines have been flooded or blocked.
