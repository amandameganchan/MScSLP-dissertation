# ORIG TITLE    Italy: Monti unveils alliance in run-up to parliamentary poll . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Italian prime minister Mario Monti has unveiled the alliance he will lead for next month’s parliamentary elections. After announcing that he would bid for a second term, the 69-year-old said the grouping will be called “With Monti for Italy.” . Monti said he would lead a single alliance in the upper house, while three separate blocs would run as a coalition with him as their leader in the lower house. The different groupings would maximise the alliance’s political power. One poll shows that Monti’s grouping is likely to attract just over 12 per cent of the vote. That compares to 40 per cent for his rivals on the left, the Democratic Party and its coalition ally Left Ecology Freedom – and 25 per cent for the most likely centre-right coalition of Silvio Berlusconi’s People of Freedom and the Northern League. Surveys show up to half of the electorate plan to abstain or are undecided. Monti replaced Berlusconi as prime minister in November 2011, when Italy was scrambling to avert a financial crisis.
