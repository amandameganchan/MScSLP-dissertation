# ORIG CONTENT  The last weekend of the Cannes Film Festival draws in an increasing number of stars and star-gazers. More celebrities will arrive to grace the red carpet at closing ceremony on Sunday night. Organisers cannot afford to have the stars stuck in traffic jams as they make their way from Nice’s Côte d’Azur Airport.
