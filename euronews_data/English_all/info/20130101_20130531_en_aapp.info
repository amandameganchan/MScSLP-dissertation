# ORIG TITLE    Big anti-corruption demo in Islamabad . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Tens of thousands of people remain on the streets of Islamabad after a call for a peaceful revolution from the Sunni cleric Tahirul Qadri. Back from exile in Canada, he wants the military and judiciary to install a caretaker government in Pakistan to oversee the upcoming elections. His call has divided the population. Some see Qadri as a champion of reform. Others fear he is a stooge of the military, which has a history of coups and interfering in elections. Things turned nasty at first light as police fired rubber bullets and tear gas as crowds converged on the parliament building. Qadri, a moderate, is thought to want to encourage peaceful demonstrations similiar to those in Cairoâ€™s Tahrir Square that ended in the fall of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
