# ORIG TITLE    Italy: no new president, no new government . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The so-called ‘pigs mess’ in Italy shows no sign of ending as parliament votes for a 5th time to elect a new president, a vote that is doomed to fail. To add to the chaos leader of the Democratic Party Pierluigi Bersani has quit after 100 deputies refused to tow the party line and vote former Prime Minister Romano Prodi into office. Italy has been without a government since the general election of two months ago delivered an inconclusive result. The country now risks being without a president as the tenure of the incumbent, Giorgio Napolitano, ends in May. With no serving government, attempts to pull the euro zones third-largest economy out of recession remain on ice as rising unemployment and falling living standards crank up the insecurity.
