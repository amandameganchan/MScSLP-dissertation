# ORIG CONTENT  The flow of refugees fleeing Syria has almost doubled since late last year, according to United Nations figures. Each day, around 5,000 people seek safe haven in neighbouring countries including Iraq and Turkey. Jordan is estimated to be hosting more than 175,000 people. The UN expects the exodus to grow and fears the refugee issue could become a long-term problem for Syria’s neighbours. “We are going to see entire villages probably coming over in the near future. People are giving up hope in certain parts of Daara and the woman I was just talking to was 95 years old. Who is 95 and decides to leave the country?” said Andrew Harper, the UNHCR representative to Jordan. Some refugees who are picked up at the border have mobility issues, while others describe walking for several days to reach the crossing point. Around 60,000 people are packed into Jordan’s Zaatari camp and they’ve each got stories to tell about their journey. Refugee Abu Ali said: “It was very difficult to cross the border because of snipers. There were lots of them and we had to walk carefully.” . 95-year-old Hamde al-Safadi from Daara said: “I never wanted to leave, but soldiers came and burnt our houses. They also attacked us from the air.” . Most families have fled with just a few possessions. With little chance to go back, they’re now totally dependent on their host country.
