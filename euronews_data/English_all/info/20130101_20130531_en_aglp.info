# ORIG CONTENT  Mass youth unemployment is threatening particularly southern Europe with a lost and alienated generation. The global recession, followed by the austerity response to Europe’s debt crisis, meant jobless rates have skyrocketed. And there is no end in sight. A recent report from the UN’s International Labour Organisation forecast youth unemployment in Europe will not fall below 26 percent before 2015. Many who are in work have no job security, with 40 percent of young Europeans on temporary contracts. Greece has the biggest problem, youth unemployment there was as a record of 64.2 percent in February. Nearly 56 percent of Spain’s under 25-year-olds were jobless in March; in Portugal it was 38.3 percent. Throughout the eurozone, almost one in four young people is without a job. By comparison – the rate in the United States is just over 16 percent. In response, European governments are also keen to increase youth training and internships as well as help young people relocate to find work. That is because some EU countries – particularly German – have large numbers of unfilled jobs. One proposal is to provide more money for the young to travel for training, perhaps by expanding the Erasmus foreign study programme.
