# ORIG TITLE    Pakistan’s ex-president in custody for two weeks . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Pakistan’s former leader, Pervez Musharraf, has been remanded in custody for two weeks over allegations of a crackdown on the judiciary during his time in office from 1999 to 2007. He will be under house arrest at his farm residence on the edge of Islamabad until his next court appearance on May 4. Hundreds of lawyers jeered at the former army chief and scuffled with his supporters outside the court. Musharraf is accused of overstepping his powers when he sacked the chief justice and placed judges under house arrest. The high court has ruled that these allegations amount to an act of terrorism so he is being tried in a special court. The trial breaks with the unwritten rule in Pakistan that ex-Generals are above the law. It is perhaps an indication of the shift in the balance of power in the country, where the military still maintains a great deal of influence, but has retreated from the overt meddling and coups of the past. Musharraf returned from years of self imposed exile last month as he hoped to stand as a candidate in next month’s general election leading his All Pakistan Muslim League (APML) party. He has so far not registered with election officials however.
