# ORIG CONTENT  Anti-austerity protests moved to Belgium on Thursday as around 30,000 people voiced their anger over cuts to the public sector. The Belgian government – like so many in Europe – is desperate to rein in its budget deficit. Protesters marching through Brussels called for higher purchasing power as average incomes continue to be squeezed. Unions say despite the cuts, the government can still afford to provide better social conditions for workers. “This is our action today to say to the government ‘enough is enough’,” said one worker. Another protester added: “The people who are here are asking for proper, honest and well paid jobs. All the workers say is: ‘no to discrimination’.” . In solidarity with the protesters, Belgium‘s main broadcaster delayed its news programmes this morning. Rallies also took place in other Belgian cities including Liege where workers from the ArcelorMittal steel factory are on strike against cuts to the workforce.
