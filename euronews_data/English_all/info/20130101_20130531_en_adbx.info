# ORIG TITLE    Migration Out of Africa . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Risking their lives in the hope of a better future – every year, thousands of men, women and children take what most of us would consider unimaginably dangerous journeys to enter Europe. In the last 20 years, it is estimated more than 16,000 migrants have died trying to get into the European Union. Despite ever tighter border controls, migrants continue to come, via perilous routes, such as Morocco in North Africa. Our debate comes as the European Union announced agreement on the signature of a Mobility Partnership with Morocco, which could lead to the conclusion of a readmission agreement that Rabat has so far refused to sign. Join us for this edition of On The Frontline, with our guests: the European Commission’s Director General for Home Affairs, Stefano Manservisi, and Morocco’s Ambassador to the European Union, Menouar Alem.
