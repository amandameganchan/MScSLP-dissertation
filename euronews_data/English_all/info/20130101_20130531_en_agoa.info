# ORIG CONTENT  French police say they have arrested a 22 year-old man near Paris on suspicion of involvement in the stabbing of a soldier in the city centre at the weekend. Police say the suspect is a recently-converted Muslim, and had been radicalised over the last three to four years. He has a police record for minor offences, including theft, and was on the radar of specialised police for his religious views. The French authorities have been worried that the attack bears similarities to the murder of several servicemen in 2011 by lone killer Mohammed Merah, and that more attacks might be on the way.
