# ORIG TITLE    Mumford &amp; Sons on tour . 
# ORIG CONTENT  British folk rock band Mumford and Sons, have kicked off the German leg of their European tour in Munich, playing to the packed out Zenith centre. The London-based band shot to fame in 2009 and their star continued to rise with their second studio album “Babel”, released last September debuting at number one in the UK and US. This year they picked up a Grammy for Album of the Year and a Brit Award for Best British Group. But the quartet try to ignore the media noise and stay true to the music, as lead singer Marcus Mumford explains. “We are just focused on the gigs really. We are trying not to focus on the media or even the awards rubbish or album sales or charts or anything like that. That stuff goes a lot – you know – happens and we know it happens and stuff but we like to distract ourselves and just focus on the gigs. And if we do that every day I don’t think there is a chance of being too affected by the other stuff, you know.” . Mumford and Sons starred in the Grammy award-winning film “Big Easy Express”. It followed their train journey from San Francisco to New Orleans on a cross country jam session with the folk rock and bluegrass musicians Old Crow Medicine Show and Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeroes. The film by director Emmett Malloy sought to chart the rise of a new generation of folk rock idols. But this has not gone to bass player Ted Dwane’s head. “I mean video is just another thing that we deem a slight distraction, really. We really understand gigs, and we love writing songs and literally everything else is a bit of distraction. And I think we feel in a way, we think of ourselves as a live band.” . The next stop for the European leg of their Gentlemen of the Road tour is Italy. They will be on the road until mid September taking in the sights in the US and Canada before heading home.
