# ORIG TITLE    Battling for territory in Lyon’s Old Town . 
# ORIG CONTENT  English football fans are notorious for making an impression on their travels. But boisterous behaviour aside, Tottenham fans appear to have been caught up in a fight for territory and political ideals in Lyon’s Old Town. The 16th century quarter attracts hundreds of thousands of tourists each year and is also home to a group known as the “House of Identity” a French far-right nationalist party, ironically (or perhaps even deliberately) based in Rue Juiverie, or Jewishness Road, just behind the Smoking Dog pub. Its supporters have often been linked to violence and intimidation of local shop owners, according to Lyon’s Rue89 journalist Lauren Burlet. “What we know is that one of the three people arrested is a member of the ‘Identitaire movement’, as it’s called by the police. That means there could be a political motive (behind the attack), but it’s too early to say for sure what exactly that motive is. What is sure is that hooligans, meaning certain Olympique Lyonnais supporters, recruit from radical, far-right groups,” said Burlet. There was much reluctance among local shop owners to speak about the group, but one trader told euronews that local businesses have been ‘taken hostage’ by the ‘Identitaires’. “They are here to mark their territory and not to protect the district, contrary to what they say,” he said. “They don’t hide their faces, everyone knows who they are. And sometimes we do see Nazi salutes from them,” said one restaurant owner who did not want to be named. Sentiments shared by a local restaurateur who is preparing to sell his business, saying he’s been driven out by the group: “Other shop-owners too have been victims of the damage they have caused here in St Jean. Elderly people, women, families, children, shop-owners, craftsmen, workers in liberal jobs, they all know that here, in the St Jean district, it belongs to the Identitaires.” . In a district reliant on tourism, Wednesday’s violence and the negative international publicity is a source of great embarrassment to local authorities. Attacks on local shop-owners is one thing, attacks on tourists are another entirely. Until now police say they have been unable to shut down Les Identitaires. With tourists rather than locals now the victims, it is hoped that the local authorities will act. It is what police promised the owner of Lyon’s Smoking Dog. He and the rest of the Old Lyon quarter hope those don’t turn out to be empty words.
