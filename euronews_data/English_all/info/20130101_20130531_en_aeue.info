Speaking to those in the disaster zone he said they must “conduct a search using high technologies, including life detectors, and rescue every single life.” . The 6.6 magnitude quake struck the mostly rural and mountainous region to the southwest of the country. The death toll has risen above 200, with around a thousand others seriously injured. Most of the deaths were concentrated in Lushan county a short drive up a valley from the city of Ya’an. The rescue effort was hampered by the narrowness of roads and landslides as well as government controls restricting access to avoid traffic jams. In the Villages close to the epicentre almost every low-rise building has collapsed. Rescuers in Lushan have already pulled around 100 people from the rubble.
