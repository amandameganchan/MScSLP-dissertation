# ORIG TITLE    French workers clash with police over Goodyear tyre plant closure . 
# ORIG CONTENT  There have been angry scenes outside the headquarters of the tyre maker Goodyear in France, over a factory that is being closed down. Staff clashed with police outside the offices near Paris as a workersâ€™ committee held a series of meetings to discuss the closure of the Amiens factory in the north of the country. Bosses announced the planned closure at the end of January, threatening more than a thousand jobs. The meetings are to hear the findings of an independent report that has looked at the economic and social impact of the closure and the possibilities of redeployment of workers . Riot police lined up to keep the protesters out of the building. They were faced with burning tyres and other makeshift missiles, and responded with tear-gas. Goodyear management claim closure is the only option after six years of negotiations that have led nowhere.
