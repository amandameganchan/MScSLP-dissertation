# ORIG TITLE    Show goes on at the Bolshoi post acid attack . 
# ORIG CONTENT  It was curtain up at the Bolshoi – for the first time since the acid attack on the ballet company’s artistic director in January. A new version of Igor Stravinsky’s ‘The Rite of Spring’ is being performed as part of a festival to celebrate the ballet’s 100th anniversary. Tatyana Baganova’s production centres on thirsty male and female dancers looking for water through symbolic submission to ideology and technology – and ultimately finding love. The attack on Sergei Filin earlier this year, which left him badly injured, revealed the Russian dance company in a new and unflattering light, with allegations of prostitution, brutal vendettas and petty jealousies taking centre stage.
