# ORIG TITLE    Bubka targets IOC presidency . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Former Olympic pole vault champion Sergei Bubka has become the sixth candidate to put his name forward to become president of the International Olympic Committee. At a sports conference in St Petersburg the 49-year-old said his sporting past has given him the qualities to succeed in the job. He said: ‘‘I believe that this experience (experience as an athlete), passion, motivation, energy, dynamism, it really gives me strong platform to work together with IOC members and friends to lead our organisation through next exciting, yet challenging chapter.” . Bubka is currently serving as the president of Ukraine’s National Olympic Committee and is an IOC member. He is also currently a senior vice president of the International Association of Athletics Federations and had been tipped – along with London 2012 Games chief Sebastien Coe – to succeed Lamine Diack as head of Athletics world governing body. The 1988 Olympic champion – who still holds indoor and outdoor world records – is the youngest in the field of candidates for IOC’s top job which also includes IOC vice-presidents Thomas Bach of Germany and Ng Ser Miang of Singapore. IOC finance commission chairman Richard Carrion of Puerto Rico, amateur boxing association chief CK Wu of Taiwan and international rowing federation head Denis Oswald of Switzerland complete the list to date. The election will take place in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 10 September.
