# ORIG TITLE    Italian government backs hostage death claim . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Claims by Nigerian militant group Ansaru that it killed seven hostages seized last month have been backed by the Italian government while the Greek foreign ministry says it believes its national is dead. Britain has followed saying the British hostage is, “is likely to have been killed”. The hostages from Italy, Britain, Greece and Lebanon were captured in a raid in the northern state of Bauchi. Ansaru said on Saturday it had killed the seven because of an apparent rescue attempt. The hostages were seized from a construction site compound. The Italian government has contested claims by Ansuru that British and Nigerian forces tried to rescue the workers and added the groups actions “can have no explanation other than blind and barbaric violence”. Nigerian authorities have said they still have no information on any such killings.
