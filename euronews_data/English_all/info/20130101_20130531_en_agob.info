# ORIG CONTENT  The happy day is here for Vincent Aubin and Bruno Boileau, who will be legally married in Montpelier making them France’s first same-sex married couple. But the sunny university city fears violence at the ceremony from opponents of France’s brand-new gay marriage legislation. Because of this plans to lay on drinks and televise the service, broadcasting it to screens in the square outside the town hall, have been ditched.

Bruno’s parents are especially happy to be here, and say they are proud to be here for their son’s wedding. “We are proud of you as well. because it’s not easy to face journalists, especially when there’s so many of you.

Last Sunday a massive march in Paris by conservatives, Catholics and extreme-right wingers against gay marriage turned violent, with more than 350 arrests.
