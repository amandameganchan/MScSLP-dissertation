# ORIG TITLE    UK: traditional robes and modern woes – immigration dominates the Queen’s Speech . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Marking the beginning of a new parliamentary session, Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II will make her traditional speech from the House of Lords. The event dates back to the 16th century, however it is a chance for the government in power to present its programme for the future. This speech, the third since David Cameron became prime minister, will be dominated by immigration. The Conservative leader is under pressure after the strong performance of the anti-immigration UK Independence Party in last week’s local elections. The speech will outline plans to get governments of EU member states to pay if their citizens use the NHS and restrictions on unemployment benefits. Migrants will have to have legally lived in the UK for a year before being entitled to legal aid. Dossier: European Monarchies .
