# ORIG CONTENT  People living in the Boston suburb of Watertown – the scene of the dramatic shoot-out between police and bombing suspects – have been recalling their experiences. Some residents have described the drama as having front-row seats at a horror show. “There was non-stop firing, bombs going off. We heard our windows being shot out. There’s bullet holes in my husband’s car, as well as mine,” said Loretta Kehayias. A week on from the deadly bombing and next to nothing is known about what may have motivated brothers Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Questions have been asked about how and if they were radicalised but their aunt says she the younger sibling, Dzhokhar, was quite ordinary. “Judging by his clothes, by the way he talked, he (Tamerlan) was American. He didn’t fit into our circle at all at the beginning. But he adapted and we got used to him. We started not paying any attention when he used English words instead of Russian,” said Patimat Suleimanova.
