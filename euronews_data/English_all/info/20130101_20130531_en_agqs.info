# ORIG TITLE    Turkey protests spread from Istanbul to Ankara . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Police in the Turkish capital Ankara used tear gas to disperse protesters trying to reach the headquarters of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP). The demonstrators had planned to protest against new laws restricting the sale of alcohol. But their rally became one of solidarity with activists in Istanbul – who are campaigning to save Gezi Park, in the Taksim area of the city. Activists in Ankara chanted, “Everywhere is resistance! Everywhere is Taksim!” . In Istanbul itself, police fired tear gas and water cannons to break up the Gezi Park protest that began four days ago. One resident of the city blamed the government, saying: “I’ve never heard of anything like it – it’s a complete joke! What do they want from this beautiful park? All around Taksim is full of shopping centres. “Why do they want to privatise here? The whole country’s been privatised. I condemn this government,” the resident continued. Scores of people have been wounded in Istanbul. Among them several members of parliament and journalists – including euronews’ Bora Bayraktar, who was slightly injured in the melée. Bayraktar reported from Istanbul: “The occupation movement, which started to protect a tiny green area in the centre has grown into a protest that looks unlikely to end any time soon.” .
