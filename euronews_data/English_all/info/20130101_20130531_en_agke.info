# ORIG TITLE    ‘Black widow’ suicide bomber attack in Dagestan . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A female suicide bomber has struck the southern Russian region of Dagestan injuring at least 18 and leaving one dead, according to police. The device was detonated in the central square of the provincial capital, Makhachkala. The attacker has been identified as Madina Alieva, widowed first in 2009 and again in 2012 when her partners both radicals linked to the Islamist insurgency were killed by security forces. In Dagestan, women who carry out these kinds of suicide attacks after losing relatives have become known as ‘Black Widows’. The Islamist insurgency in the North Caucasus region has grown more violent in recent years. Earlier this week another attack in the same town killed four and injured 44 others.
