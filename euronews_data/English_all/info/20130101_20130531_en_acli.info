# ORIG TITLE    European hopes for stable govt in Italy . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Stability in a country that is such a significant European economy has been a stated aim both inside Italy and beyond its borders. But the inconclusive election result in a country already saddled with massive debt and going through a prolonged recession prompted cautious responses throughout Europe. European Parliament President Martin Schulz said: “We need a stable government in one of the most important member states of the European Union. Italy is a G8 country, it is the fourth largest economy within the European Union, one of the pillars of the eurozone, so what happens in Italy affects all of us.” . Italy’s election results were watched particularly closely in Germany, a country that is already acting as the EU’s paymaster. Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said: “Italy plays a central role in the successful handling of Europe’s debt crisis and that is the reason we expect that the policy of consolidation and reform will be continued by a new government.” . In Paris, the French finance minister said the election outcome “creates difficulties” but does not raise questions about advances made in the eurozone. Pierre Moscovici added: “I hope that Mr Bersani will be able to form a government that will be a friendly counterpart for us and which is committed to European construction.” .
