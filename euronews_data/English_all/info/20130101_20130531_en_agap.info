# ORIG CONTENT  No sooner had the inked dried on the new law approving same-sex marriage in France than the first couple had announced their nuptials. Invitations to the marriage of Vincent and Bruno in Montpellier have been sent out for May 29 after they officially registered their intention to marry at the town hall, though arrangements were underway for some weeks before. “Vincent and Bruno are making their preparations and so are we. At the Montpellier Town Hall we are getting ready for the big day,” announced Montpellier Mayor Hélène Mandroux . “I would say it’s the evolution of society. Personally I think that when society evolves in a certain way, meaning the same rights for everyone, that’s an excellent development,” she continued. President of a Montpellier LGBT rights group, the day will especially sweet for Vincent Autin, as the culmination of a battle for equal rights to marry. “It means that we can love one another, we can look after our children, and there will be many other weddings, thousands of weddings in the days and months to come,” enthused Vincent. “That’s the most beautiful symbol of a France that is more fair since this morning,” he concluded. Though the law has been passed, the issue continues to fuel controversy. Over the past few months scenes of violent demonstrations have grabbed the headlines during the debate over same-sex marriage. Opponents of marriage for all were out in force in Paris on Friday as the bill passed into law. Another protest has been announced for May 26 and opposition MPs claim they will revise the law if voted into power in 2017.
