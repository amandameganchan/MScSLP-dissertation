# ORIG CONTENT  Bulgarian Prime Minister Boiko Borisov told parliament on Wednesday that his entire government has resigned. The move came after nationwide protests against the effects of high electricity prices and austerity measures in the EU’s poorest nation. On Monday, Borisov sacked his unpopular finance minister for not moving fast enough to liberalise the country’s energy industry. In response to widespread complaints about sky-rocketing electricity bills, Borisov also confirmed that the distribution licence of electricity provider CEZ will be revoked. There has been no indication on whether July’s parliamentary election will be brought forward. Borisov blamed police brutality for his personal decision to resign after 25 protesters were taken to hospital after clashes on Tuesday. “I will not participate in a government under which police are beating people,” Borisov told parliament.
