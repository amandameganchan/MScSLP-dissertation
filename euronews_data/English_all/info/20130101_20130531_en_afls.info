# ORIG CONTENT  For many in Germany, this case has reopened an uncomfortable debate about whether the country must do more to tackle the far-right and lingering racist attitudes.

Prosecutors say the gang chose people running small businesses or shops as easy, vulnerable targets, in a bid to terrify migrants. They are even charged with compiling a DVD containing an illustrated guide of where and how they carried out the killings. If found guilty, Zschaepe faces life behind bars.
