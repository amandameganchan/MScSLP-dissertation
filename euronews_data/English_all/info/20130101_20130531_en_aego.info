# ORIG CONTENT  Amnesty International launched a new campaign on Tuesday to end discrimination of Roma people in Europe. The human rights organisation wants the European Commission and EU nations to do more to help this ethnic minority. “The situation of Roma people is unfortunately not improving. There are efforts made from the European level but EU member states are actually not moving forward significantly to change the situation on the ground,” said Nicolas Berger, director of Amnesty International. There are an estimated 12 million Roma people living in Europe; half of them in EU countries. Activists say they are the victims of prejudice and continued social exclusion. Several European countries including France, Italy and Romania continue with forced evictions, prompting criticism from rights groups.
