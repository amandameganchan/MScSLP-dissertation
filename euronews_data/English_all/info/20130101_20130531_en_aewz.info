# ORIG TITLE    ‘France will never give in’ – foreign minister on embassy attack . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Images have emerged of the explosion outside the French Embassy in the Libyan capital of Tripoli. The blast from a suspected car bomb injured two guards and destroyed the reception area. Libyan Foreign Minister Mohammed Abdel Aziz has condemned the bombing as a “terrorist act”. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius joined him in denouncing the act. “It is an attack that targets not only France but all the countries that fight against terrorism. I’m going to travel immediately to Libya. This attack aimed to kill. France will never give in,” Fabius said. Fabius added that security would be increased at French missions across the Middle East and Sahel region as a response. All activities at the French School and Cultural Institute in Tripoli have been suspended. Security remains a concern in post-war Libya. A US mission was attacked in Benghazi last September, but this incident marks the first attack on a diplomatic mission in the capital.
