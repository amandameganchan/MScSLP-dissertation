# ORIG TITLE    63rd Berlinale Film Festival opens today . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Final preparations are underway for the 63rd Berlinale film festival which will screen some of the best new European and international films. 17 of the films in this year’s festival have received support from the EU’s Media programme. This year’s bill is pretty diverse, says Director Dieter Kosslick: “The main topic, I see it already, will be if you see the programme as a whole that women are really strongly represented in this festival. Not only as subject matters but also as directors.” . 400 films will be screened at the 11-day event. Nineteen productions including big-budget Hollywood movies, new work by European veterans and a clutch of debut features will compete for the top awards. The all-star line-up includes Matt Damon, Jude Law, Geoffrey Rush, Catherine Deneuve, and Jeremy Irons on Berlin’s snow-dusted red carpet.
