# ORIG CONTENT  After more than a month of silence, there has finally been an update on the health of Hugo Chavez. Venezuela has been languishing in political limbo since Chavez underwent a fourth round of surgery for cancer in Cuba back in December. The 58-year-old developed a lung infection. Regional heads of state rallied round but there has been no more news on his condition until now. “The President’s condition has improved over the last few days,” said Information Minister Ernesto Villegas, “and he is following doctors’ orders strictly. The President still needs help to overcome difficulties with his breathing. He is conscious.” . Opposition supporters rallied across Venezuela at the weekend, claiming that the postponement of Chavez’ inauguration was unconstitutional. Politicians say they will present their case before the regional human rights regulatory body in Costa Rica.
