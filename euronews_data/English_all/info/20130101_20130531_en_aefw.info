# ORIG CONTENT  The US Secretary of State John Kerry took part in a remembrance ceremony in Jerusalem to mark Holocaust Day. He is in the middle east trying to nudge both sides in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict back to the negotiating table. After recent claims that Obama’s administration might not have the same appetite for the peace process as, for example, Bill Clinton’s, this is Kerry’s third trip to the region in as many weeks. A fortnight ago during President Obama’s visit Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu invited the Palestinians to resume talks ‘without preconditions.’ . A prinicipal obstacle to progress has been Israel’s determination to build Jewish settlements on land vital to the Palestinians for their independent state. Kerry met the Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas at the weekend, but it appears discussions are still centred on how to create a positive climate for talks, rather than the content of the negotiations themselves.
