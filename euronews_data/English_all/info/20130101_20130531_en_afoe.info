# ORIG CONTENT  Nawaz Sharif is widely tipped to become Pakistan’s next prime minister in the country’s general election on May 11. Polls have been placing two-time prime minister Sharif, and his Muslim League party, in the lead. Former cricketer Imran Khan is also a contender. He was hospitalised on May 7 after he from a platform makeshift lift at a campaign rally. Analysts said the injury could give him a big boost at the polls, and put a potentially serious dent in Sharif’s lead. Khan is the favoured candidate of Pakistan’s powerful military, which ruled the country for more than half of its 66-year history. The vote marks the first time a civilian government in Pakistan has completed a full five-year term. In the troubled north-west of Pakistan, three people have been killed and more than 20 wounded by a blast at a police station in Bannu. A suicide bomber drove a car packed with explosives into a barrier outside the building.
