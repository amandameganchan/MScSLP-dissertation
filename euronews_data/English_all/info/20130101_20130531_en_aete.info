# ORIG CONTENT  A judge in Guatemala has suspended the genocide trial of former military ruler Efrain Rios Montt. The 86-year-old was being tried for a counter-insurgency plan that killed more than 1,700 members of the Ixil indigenous group in 1982. There has been an ongoing dispute over the appointment of Judge Carol Patricia Flores. Mr Rios Montt denies the charges and his lawyers argue that the trial should be annulled.
