# ORIG CONTENT  Israel’s Prime Minister has sharpened his tone towards Iran, ahead of a visit to the Middle East by US President Barack Obama later this month. Benhamin Netanyahu claimed sanctions and diplomacy are not working and a clear and credible military threat is needed to stop Iran manufacturing a nuclear weapon. “From the bottom of my heart, and with the clarity of my brain, words alone will not stop Iran. Sanctions alone will not stop Iran. Sanctions must be coupled with a clear and credible military threat if diplomacy and sanctions fail,” he said during a webcast to a symposium in Washington DC. In Vienna, Yukiyo Amano, the head of the world’s nuclear authority, said he could not confirm that Iran’s nuclear programme is purely domestic. ‘‘Iran is not providing the necessary cooperation to enable us to provide credible assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities. The Agency therefore cannot conclude that all nuclear material in Iran is in peaceful activities.’‘ . The Israeli Prime Minister has hinted at plans to hit Iran’s nuclear sites if he feels peaceful means have foundered. Clearly, the latest round of talks between Tehran and and the Five-plus-one countries (the United States, China, Russia, France, Britain and Germany) in Kazakhstan last week have done little to smooth tensions in the volatile region.
