# ORIG TITLE    Champions League: Dortmund survive late scare to reach final . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Borussia Dortmund reached their second Champions League final after knocking out Real Madrid despite losing 2-0 at the Bernabeu on Tuesday. Jose Mourinhoâ€™s side looked more likely to score from the start but left themselves too much to do as Cristiano Ronaldo and Mezut Ozil both missed early clear-cut chances which could have completely changed the storyline. French international Karim Benzema gave Real hope from close range in the 82nd minute before Sergio Ramos doubled their advantage soon after. Despite a late push from the hosts and a penalty appeal turned down in the dying moments, Dortmund held on, giving them a major boost ahead of the Wembley final on May 25.
