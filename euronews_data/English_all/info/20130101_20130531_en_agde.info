# ORIG TITLE    In Cannes: MEDIA Prize awarded to Thomas Vinterberg . 
# ORIG CONTENT  At Cannes Film Festival the Prix Media has been won by Danish director Thomas Vinterberg, his co-author Tobias Lindholm and his produer Sisse Graum from the production company Zentropa. The award is for the best film with box office potential which received funding from the EU’s Media Programme. The prize was awarded by the EU’s COmmissioner for Education, Culture, Multilingualism and Youth, Androulla Vassilou. The winning film is called Festen/Celebration. Thomans Vinterberg commented: “Well I have learned that you have to embrace the success when its there because it won’t last for ever – I have also learned that having success with something does not make you a better film maker. At the end of the day this is all fantastic and wonderful but the work and the craft on your desk and in front of the camera, that’s what counts.” . He also paid tribute to the Media Programme’s importance as a mainstay of film-making in smaller EU countries like Denmark: “Without MEDIA or the Danish Film Institute we could not survive as a nation with film making as an art form. It would slowly become more and more provincial, more and more mediocre so the MEDIA Prize and the MEDIA programme is extremely important.” . This is why the European Commission is insisting that culture and the audiovisual sector are exempt from negotiations on the EU-US free trade deal. Androulla Vassiliou said: “I am determined to make sure that during the negotiations for trade agreement with the USA we do not compromise our culture and our cultural diversity and our policies in supporting our cultural wealth.” .
