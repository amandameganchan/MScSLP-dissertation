# ORIG TITLE    Nestle is drawn into the horsemeat scandal . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Swiss-based Nestle has become the latest company to find itself embroiled in the horsemeat-for-beef scandal sweeping Europe. The worldâ€™s biggest food company has withdrawn beef pasta meals from sale in Italy and Spain after tests revealed traces of equine DNA. A spokesperson says a problem has been identified with a supplier from Germany. Last week Nestle said its products did not contain horse meat. It now says it has been detected at above one percent but still at very low levels.
