# ORIG TITLE    Klopp plays down Dortmund’s final chances . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The shift in dominance of European football towards Germany was highlighted in the brightest of yellows on Wednesday night following Borussia Dortmund’s thrashing of Real Madrid in the first leg of the pair’s Champions League semi-final. The 4-1 rout came a day after Bayern Munich produced a 4-0 drubbing of Barcelona in their opening leg of their semi. Despite Dortmund’s very healthy lead coach Jurgen Klopp remained cautious about talking up his side’s chances of progressing. Klopp said: “Nothing is decided, it’s only the first half of the tie. We are not so experienced in this tournament and things like this but experienced enough to know that we have to work unbelievably hard in Madrid.” . It was all doom, gloom and disappointment in the Spanish press the following morning, but coach of nine-time European champions Real, Jose Mourinho, was not giving up hope just yet and insisted the Germans will have to be at their best next week to book their final ticket. Mourinho said: “Everything is possible in football. They will have to fight and get the most out of themselves next Tuesday to try to make the impossible possible in Santiago Bernabeu. Again, everything is possible in football and my players will perform accordingly.” . With striker Robert Lewandowski firing on all cylinders, a side full of confidence and 4-1 up from the first leg Dortmund will now surely fancy their chances of reaching the final of Europe’s top club competition for the first time in 16 years.
