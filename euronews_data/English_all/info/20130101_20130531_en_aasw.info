# ORIG CONTENT  Louis Vuitton continues on its journey to far flung destinations for its menswear collection at Paris Fashion Week. Designer Kim Jones took to the Himalayas and came back with a variety of furs. Dries van Noten is a designer who believes the rule book is for others and for his Autumn/Winter collection he wanted to design clothes that had never been seen in a man’s wardrobe. He described the idea behind the collection: . “This collection we call it ‘The Morning After,’ so it’s really a boy after a wild night of too much of everything, stayed with his girlfriend, tumbles out of bed in the morning, grabs some clothes to get some milk or some croissants and things like that, so that’s the spirit of this collection. So it’s a lot of luxurious materials, soft, peignoirs, a pajamas, very comfortable, mixing mens’ and women’s clothes.” . Paris favourite, Jean Paul Gaultier decided a strip show was appropriate as the models eased out of their layers new outfits formed. The audience were of course charmed.
