# ORIG CONTENT  The US Secretary of State John Kerry has said the opposition in Syria needs more help in its struggle to overthrow the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. He was speaking in Paris on the latest leg of his European tour. Kerry said the US is hoping to find ways to speed up a transition of power in Syria, and that might demand changing what he called ‘Assad’s calculations.’ . “ He (Assad) . needs to know that he can’t shoot his way out of this and so we need to convince him of that, and I think the opposition needs more help in order to be able to do that and we are working together to have a united position.” . At a Friends of Syria meeting in Rome, Kerry is due to explore ideas on how the process might be accelerated. The United States has supplied aid for refugees, but one media report claims the US is now considering direct aid for the rebels too. The Washington Post said that could include providing body armour, armoured vehicles and military training.
