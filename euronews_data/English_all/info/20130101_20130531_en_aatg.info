# ORIG TITLE    German state election barometer for September . 
# ORIG CONTENT  There was enthusiastic applause for German chancellor, Angela Merkel in Lower Saxony. She was visiting the region to support Lower Saxony’s state premier David McAllister ahead of Sunday’s regional election. The chancellor’s Christian Democrats have been battered by the centre-left Social Democrats and Greens in 12 regional elections stretching back to 2009. Polls had them trailing in this ballot but now they are catching up. “We are extremely motivated. We are all electrified after we caught up so much. Now that we are in the process of getting ahead, it’s clear. We want to win and we will win on January 20,” said David McAllister. The Mayor of Hanover Stephan Weil is hoping to unseat David McAllister who inherited the state premiership three years ago. Social Democrat Weil has the support of former German Chancellor Gerard Schroeder and Peer Steinbrueck who is the SDP candidate for Chancellor in September’s general election. The Social Democrats will need the support of the Greens to win this swing state. It is in the words of Angela Merkel “a pivotal election.” .
