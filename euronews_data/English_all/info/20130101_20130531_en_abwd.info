# ORIG TITLE    Apple considering its cash pile, probably developing a watch . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Apple’s Chief Executive Tim Cook has said it is carefully considering calls for the company to return more cash to investors; it is currently sitting on over 100 billion euros of reserves. Cook said the company’s board is in “very active discussions” on how to dole out more of its hoard of cash and marketable securities. Cook was responding to a lawsuit from activist investor David Einhorn who runs Greenlight Capital and who has accused Apple of clinging to a “Depression-era” mentality. A computer on your wrist? . A timely way to spend some of that money might be a foray into the world of watches. Reports continue to come thick and fast that Apple is working on a wristwatch like device. After the New York Times and Wall Street Journal broke the story, Bloomberg and others now report Apple has about 100 product designers on the project, which suggests it is no longer an experiment but moving towards development. Reportedly it would use the same operating platform as the iPhone and the iPad and be made with curved glass. Apple has declined to comment on the reports.
