# ORIG TITLE    The first French same-sex marriage takes place in Montpellier. 
# ORIG CONTENT  Vincent Autin and Bruno Boileau have tied the knot amid tight security to become the first married gay couple in France since the law reform last month. The ceremony was held in the city hall in front of the mayor, family and friends as well as some well-wishing members of the public. Although early reports suggest some scuffles broke out outside the building. Just days before more than a hundred and fifty thousand opponents of the new law took to the streets of Paris in protest, more than 350 people were arrested after the demonstration turned violent. In May France became the 14th country in the world and the 9th in Europe to legalise gay marriage.
