# ORIG TITLE    Italian cinema says ciao to London . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Cinema Made in Italy is a London festival showcasing Italian films. It includes ‘Magnifica Presenza’ directed by Ferzan Ozpetek, which is about a lonely baker who finds himself living with ghosts. Ozpetek says there is a historical twist: “In the movie I discuss what is real and what is not when we find out why these presences exist because we wanted them to be from World War II. “Going back to the actors from that time you automatically return to Pirandello and his world is divided between reality and fiction. The film is really about this. Not about magic but about reality and fiction.” . Ozpetek believes his international background adds to his work: “I’m Turkish and I’ve been living in Italy for 36 years. I was 17 years old when I came to Italy. “I learned about cinema working as an assistant director, and I have always produced, filmed and shown my films in Italy. So the influence of Turkey is secondary for me, but I’m influenced by both countries and that’s important because they look at things differently.” . Click on the video link to watch our report .
