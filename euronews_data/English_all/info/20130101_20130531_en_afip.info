# ORIG TITLE    Koreas: Kaesong industrial complex silenced . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The last seven South Korean workers left the Kaesong industrial complex in North Korea on May 3 — and with them went the final channel of communication between the two Koreas. Now silent, Kaesong was a bustling hub, comprising and employing thousands of workers from the North. Hong Yang-ho, the Chairman of the Kaesong Industrial District Management Committee, said he hoped it would open again: “I’ve repeatedly emphasised in the process of negotiations with North Korea, that the Kaesong industrial complex should be normalised as soon as possible — so that our companies in the complex will minimise the damage and the factories can operate again.” . Angered by UN sanctions and joint US-South Korean military drills, North Korea has repeatedly threatened its neighbour with attack. Just north of the heavily fortified border between the two Koreas, Kaesong’s operations have been increasingly blocked by Pyongyang. The now-defunct project was launched in 2000 in a bid to improve ties between the two Koreas.
