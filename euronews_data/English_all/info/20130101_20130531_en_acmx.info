# ORIG CONTENT  Stephane Hessel, the French best-selling author and veteran diplomat has died at the age of 95. He was a prominent Resistance figure during World War II and later widely admired as a rights activist. His 2010 work “Time for Outrage” sold more than 3.5 million copies worldwide and inspired the global “indignados” anti-austerity movement. Hessel argued that the French need to again become outraged, as were those who participated in the Resistance during the Second World War because of the growing gap between the very rich and the very poor, as well as France’s treatment of its illegal immigrants. He also campaigned for greater rights for Palestinians.
