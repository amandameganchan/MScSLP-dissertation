# ORIG TITLE    Mobile and tablet annual tech fest in Barcelona . 
# ORIG CONTENT  It is a busy start for the Mobile World Congress – Barcelona’s annual tech event. Vying for the attentions of the visitors are offerings from 1,500 exhibitors, including the latest from Nokia and Samsung. Our euronews correspondent on the ground told us: “Here in Barcelona, 70,000 visitors are expected. It’s open warfare between the different operating systems of smartphone with Android leading the way by some margin. Samsung unveiled their new Galaxy Note, and we’ve also seen Nokia’s new Lumia for the first time. Samsung’s new Galaxy Note is slightly bigger and has better resolution than Apple’s bestselling iPad Mini. It boasts a 20.3cm screen with a resolution of 189 pixels per inch (ppi). With the giants of Apple, Google and Microsoft absent, the event is a real opportunity for other players. Nokia were hoping to make waves with the unveiling of their new Lumia. But they’ve got their work cut out – not for nothing is the industry known as the “phone and tablet wars.” .
