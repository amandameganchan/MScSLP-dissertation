# ORIG TITLE    ‘Dear Mr. President’: a welcome message for Obama from Israeli peace activists . 
# ORIG CONTENT  US President Barack Obama is due to fly into Jerusalem on March 20 for a landmark visit. It is his first trip to Israel and the Palestinian territories since winning the White House in 2008. Israeli activists from the NGO ‘Peace Now’,which promotes a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, have prepared a huge banner for him. It reads “we, the people want peace”. Yariv Oppenheimer, Director of ‘Peace Now’, explained: “Hopefully President Obama will be able to see this big sign from his window and to understand that most Israelis are supporting the peace effort.” . In Ramallah, Palestinians have taken to the streets calling for improved conditions. Teacher Sabri Abu Maria said: “Unfortunately, the economic situation here is very bad. This affects the citizens so they don’t feel as committed to their country. It’s getting worse every day.” . Those living in Ramallah and the Gaza strip are hopeful that a donor meeting held in Brussels on March 19 could help improve the Palestinian Authority’s financial crisis.
