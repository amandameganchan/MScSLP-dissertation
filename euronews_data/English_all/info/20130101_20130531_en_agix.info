Nasrallah also said: “I testify that the present Syrian leadership has always been prepared to sit down and negotiate, to reach a political solution and implement major reforms. But the opposition keeps refusing to have this dialogue.” . The fiercest fighting in Syria is in the rebel stronghold of Qusair, near the Lebanese border. Hezbollah fighters have been helping the Syrian government as it tries to seize back the strategically-important town. At least thirty Hezbollah fighters have been killed in Qusair, according to opposition activists.
