# ORIG TITLE    Demonstrators demand Brussels outlaws fish discards . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A coalition of NGOs has organised a demonstration in Brussels calling for the practice of discarding dead fish to be banned as part of the new EU Common Fisheries Policy. The demonstration was held as EU Ministers were meeting to finalise the new policy which has been on the table for the past two years. Tony Long, the director of WWF Europe, said: “We want Fisheries Ministers to say that the practice of throwing live fish or even dead fish back over the side of the boat, what’s called discards, that that practice has got to stop.” . Under the umbrella “All Aboard!”, NGOs including Birdlife, Fish Fight, Greenpeace, Oceana, Ocean 2012, Paintafish and the WWF warn that overfishing remains a grave problem. The WWF has warned that unless action is taken, stocks of over-fished species like Mediterranean bluefin tuna and Altlantic cod risk becoming unsustainable.
