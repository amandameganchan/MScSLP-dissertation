# ORIG TITLE    Renault sales growth pledge . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Renault says it will return to sales growth this year. That pledge came as the French carmaker announced a 6.3 percent fall in sales last year. Europe was the black spot with an 18 percent drop. Outside Europe, Renaultâ€™s sales grew by 9.1 percent. At the same time the company is resisting pressure from the Paris government to build cars in France for its Japanese alliance partner Nissan. The government has a 15 percent stake in Renault, and is likely to press for French production of a planned Nissan hatchback. But the Japanese carmaker would prefer to build the car at a more competitive Spanish facility, according to a Renault-Nissan source.
