# ORIG CONTENT  Syria rebels claim to have taken control of the key city of Dael in Daraa province in the south of the country. Unverified amateur video is said to show fighting there, with rebel fighters in the city’s streets. Fighting was also reported in the northern city of Aleppo along with clashes on the outskirts of Damascus. Rebels have captured and held large parts of northern and eastern Syria, but have not been able to establish a solid foothold in the south. Dael is around 15 kilometres from the Jordanian border and is on the strategic highway connecting it with the capital Damascus. News of the rebel gains came as the Turkish authorities said they had seized thousands of guns in a warehouse near the Syrian border. The firearms – including more than 5,000 shotguns and rifles, and 10,000 cartridges – were discovered during a raid in a village on the edge of the Turkish town of Akcakale . The owner of the warehouse was reported to have been arrested. Turkey supports the uprising against President al-Assad but has ruled out arming rebels, fearing it could be drawn into a destabilising regional conflict.
