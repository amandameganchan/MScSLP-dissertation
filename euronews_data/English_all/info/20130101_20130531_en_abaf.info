# ORIG TITLE    Cassez describes the “injustice” of her Mexico jail time . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Back on French soil, seven years after her arrest in Mexico, Florence Cassez has said she always felt free in her mind. On Wednesday, Mexico Supreme Court over-turned her conviction for kidnapping, ruling that her trial had been tainted. Cassez had been facing a 60 year sentence, but says being behind bars was not the hardest part: . “What was the most difficult thing for me? The injustice. They talk about you, tell lies about you. That is terrible. For me, it was the worst thing.” . “Not the jail conditions or being forced to dress in prison navy blues, not even the fact of being incarcerated. But the injustice,” Ceases added. The case had put a strain on diplomatic relations between France and Mexico, as Euronews correspondent Giovanni Maggi reports from Paris: . “This concludes an international affair that has preoccupied France for seven years. Now we wonder how this happy ending was affected by the changes of leader in both Mexico and France, and the more cautious diplomacy of President Hollande than his predecessor.” .
