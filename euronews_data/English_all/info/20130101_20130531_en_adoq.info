# ORIG TITLE    Pakistan: Musharraf sets sights on political comeback . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Former president Pervez Musharraf has returned to Pakistan after more than four years of self-imposed exile – seeking a possible political comeback. The former army general, who seized power in a 1999 coup, is hoping to regain influence so that his party can win seats in a May general election. Musharraf made the journey from Dubai in defiance of judicial probes and death threats from Taliban militants. “Where has the Pakistan I left five years ago gone? My heart cries tears of blood when I see the state of the country today,” he told supporters in Karachi. “I have come back for you. I want to restore the Pakistan I left.” . Musharraf was forced out of office in 2008 amid growing discontent over his rule and a threat of impeachment. He has since lived in Dubai and London.
