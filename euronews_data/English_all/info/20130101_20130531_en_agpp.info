# ORIG TITLE    Trial begins in Tunisia of ‘Femen’ activist . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Women’s rights activist Amina Tyler has gone on trial in Tunisia. She was arrested earlier this month for placing a feminist banner on the wall of a mosque and trying to expose her breasts. After hearing arguments from prosecutors and the defence, the judge adjourned the session to deliberate on the charge. Outside the court, around 200 protesters, many religious conservatives, chanted slogans against her, accusing her of attacking the city and insulting Islam. They also shouted insults at the defence lawyers and accused them of “sullying” the image of the city. On the eve of the trial, three other members of the feminist group Femen held a topless protest against her arrest in the Tunisian capital. Wearing only shorts, the women chanted “Free Amina” and “ A women’s spring is coming”. The 19-year-old was arrested in the religious centre of Kairouan at a time then an ultraconservative Muslim group was due to hold a conference. She is being tried in the same city, formally charged with carrying a dangerous object – thought to have been a canister of pepper spray. Her lawyers argued that was not illegal and said if charges were extended to include threatening public order, she could face up to a year in prison.
