# ORIG TITLE    Eurovision dress rehearsals . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Eurovision contestants have been going through their final dress rehearsals ahead of the competition’s semi-finals, which begin on May 14. Hopefuls from all over Europe have been arriving in Malmo, Sweden, to compete for the song prize. Sixteen of them will sing in the first semi-final for a place in the final on May 18. Loreen, who won last year in the Azeri capital Baku, is excited about performing on the Eurovision stage again – as a star guest in her home country this time. She said: “I haven’t been this nervous since Baku, really, and I’ve been on a lot of stages after Baku. This is actually very personal.” . Norway’s Margret Becker is one of this year’s favourites. The UK, which has been holding out for a Eurovision hero for fifteen years, has put forward Bonnie Tyler, an international pop star in the 1980s.
