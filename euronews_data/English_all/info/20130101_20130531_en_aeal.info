# ORIG CONTENT  Talks in Brussels to end the deadlock over the Serbian north in Kosovo have broken down between the Prime Ministers of both countries. Serbian Prime Minister Ivica Dacic and Kosovo counterpart Hashim Thaci ended the marathon 12 hour session with no agreement, the eighth time they’ve met. EU Foreign Policy Chief Catherine Ashton has been mediating for months. She told reporters, “A number of proposals were put on the table. The gap between the two sides is very narrow, but deep. They will now both go back and consult with their colleagues in their capitals and will let me know in the next few days of their decision”. Kosovo declared independence in 2008. But the many ethnic Serbians in northern Kosovo have refused to accept the Kosovan government in Pristina. This has led to tensions with the Albanian majority in Kosovo, mainly along the northern border with Serbia. Serbia now faces mounting pressure to normalise ties with its neighbours before achieving their goal of EU membership.
