# ORIG TITLE    Spitfire searchers find water-filled crate . 
# ORIG CONTENT  In Myanmar it is believed the first of a number of long lost Royal Air Force World War Two Spitfires has been found. American engineers are thought to have buried as many as 140 of the iconic combat planes in wooden crates towards the end of the war. Myanmar is the former British colony Burma which had been held briefly by Japan during hostilities. The first evidence of the find is sketchy provided by a camera inserted into a crate that has been excavated. Project leader David Cundall explained: “The images that I’ve seen on camera are not conclusive at all. But it’s very encouraging that we found a wooden crate in the same area where the Americans buried the Spitfires. The water is muddy. It’s causing problems. We can’t see through the water. As I said, we have to pump the water out before we can give you more information.” . The single-seater fighter became a symbol of British resistance in World War Two. It was instrumental in winning the Battle of Britain in the skies above southern England. Only a handful of the 20,000 or so that were made remain airworthy. It is hoped as many as 60 Spitfires can be recovered during this part of the search project.
