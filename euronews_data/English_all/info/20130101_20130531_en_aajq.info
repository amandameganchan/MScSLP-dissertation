# ORIG TITLE    Kurdish deaths: the PKK’s Paris connection . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Kurdish activists have suggested the Turkish state was responsible for the women’s murders. A senior member of the ruling party in Turkey has blamed internal feuding within the PKK. Euronews turned to a specialist on Turkey at IRIS – the French Institut de Relations Internationales et Stratégiques – and asked him what the consequences were for the peace process. Giovanni Magi, euronews Paris correspondent: “What are the consequences now for the peace process?” . Didier Billion, IRIS Deputy Director: “If the fundamental reason is to see the collapse of this complicated, difficult process which will surely be very long… if this is the objective (of those behind the murders) we can only hope that they will not succeed. Obviously, this ‘Kurdish issue’ in Turkey is THE main challenge for Turkey to finally be able to pursue its democratisation process through to the end.” . euronews: “Paris has always been an important place for the PKK, mainly for financial fundraising…” . Didier Billion: “As far as Paris is concerned, it is true that for a number of years there have been many cases of “revolutionary taxes”, as PKK leaders call them. Personally, I would call it a racket towards Turkish or Kurdish shop owners who live in Paris. Remember the PKK is classed a terrorist organisation not only by France but also by the European Union, by the United States, and by Turkey which goes without saying. The anti-terrorist arm of the Paris prosecutors’ department has conducted several operations and inquiries which have led to to some arrests and convictions of people in charge of the PKK who were implicated in illegal financial operations. So it is not entirely new for this financial dimension to be present in the PKK’s activities in France and in Paris.” .
