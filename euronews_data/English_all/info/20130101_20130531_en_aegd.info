# ORIG CONTENT  Both sides have claimed victory in Montenegroâ€™s presidential election raising the prospect of a dispute, as the small mountainous Adriatic country bids to join the EU. There is still no official word from the state electoral commission but both the incumbent Filip Vujanovic and opposition challenger Miodrag Lekic have taken to the airwaves to announce to the 680,000 strong population that they have won. Though all of the real power is vested in the Prime Minister, a victory for Lekic would deal a painful blow to the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) after more than two decades in power. The state electoral commission, which had been expected to give the result during the night said it will announce the official result within 48 hours of the polls closing on Sunday evening. A disputed result could prove problematic as the European Union is trying to steer the country through a raft of reforms to ready it for membership.
