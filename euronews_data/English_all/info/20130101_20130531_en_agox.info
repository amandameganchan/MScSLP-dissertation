# ORIG CONTENT  Paris St Germain sporting director Leonardo has been banned for nine months from all official functions for pushing a referee. Television footage showed the Brazilian bumping into match official Alexandre Castro with his left shoulder in the Parc des Princes tunnel after the French champions drew 1-1 with Valenciennes in Ligue 1 earlier this month. The club has also received a three point suspended sentence. But it has been given the right to appeal.
