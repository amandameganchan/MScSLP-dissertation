# ORIG TITLE    Egypt clashes on second anniversary of Mubarak overthrow . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The second anniversary of the departure of the Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarak has been marked by protests demanding the resignation of President Mohamed Mursi. The clashes were less violent than during previous outbreaks of unrest. But water cannon and teargas were used from inside the presidential compound to disperse youths throwing rocks from outside. They accuse Mursi’s Muslim Brotherhood of hijacking Egypt’s revolution and seeking to monopolise power. The trouble followed an earlier peaceful march by thousands of demonstrators. Riot police later chased the protesters away from the palace and into side-streets. Among other demands, the demonstrators want the authorities held to account for the deaths of dozens of people during the recent troubles.
