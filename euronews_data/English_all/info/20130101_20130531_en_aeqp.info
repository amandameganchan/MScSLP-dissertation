# ORIG TITLE    “Suspicious substance” in letter to Obama . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A letter containing a “suspicious substance” has been found addressed to US President Obama, but a White House spokesperson said that so far there was no evidence to suggest any connection with the bombings in Boston. The discovery comes at a time of heightened US security following the attacks, which are still being investigated. Jay Carney, the White House Press Secretary, confirmed that a letter had been sent to President Obama, and said that it had been intercepted at “an off-site mail facility” where “it was noticed to contain a suspicious substance.” Tests were undertaken, he said, and the FBI was leading the investigation. The find was made on the heels of the discovery of lethal toxin ricin in a letter addressed to a US Senator. Amidst contradictory reports of other suspect packages being found, the US Senate was briefly evacuated, . There are reports that both suspicious letters were posted from the same location in Memphis, Tennessee and that both contained ricin. This has provoked comparisons with the letters containing anthrax which were sent to the White House in 2001 following the 9/11 attacks.
