# ORIG CONTENT  Two separate mine disasters in China have left scores feared dead and raised questions about the industry’s safety. In Tibet news emerged several hours after rescue attempts had begun to find at least 80 people buried beneath a massive landslide which engulfed the sleeping quarters of workers at a gold mine. The landslide is said to have happened on Friday near Lhasa. In the second incident 28 people were killed in a blast at Baboa coal mine in Jilin province in the northeast of the country. China is a major consumer of coal but its mines are among the world’s deadliest due to lax regulation and corruption. An investigation is underway into the Tibetan landslide which is likely to inflame critics of Chinese rule who say Beijing’s interests are driven by the region’s mineral wealth.
