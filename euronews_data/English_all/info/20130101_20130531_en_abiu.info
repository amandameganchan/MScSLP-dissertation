# ORIG CONTENT  British Prime Minister David Cameron has made an unannounced visit to Libya to discuss concerns over security in the region. Meeting with Libyan prime minister Ali Zeidan, Cameron said the UK is willing to provide training and advice to Libya in the fight against terrorism. Within the last week, unspecified security threats prompted warnings to UK citizens in Benghazi and Tripoli. At a joint press conference, Cameron announced Scottish police officers have for the first time been given permission to visit Libya as part of the investigation into the 1988 Lockerbie bombing. Cameronâ€™s stop in Libya comes directly after his visit to Algeria, where he also discussed how to fight militants in North Africa. Security in the region has become particularly important for the UK since the deaths of six British workers during an attack on a gas facility in Algeria two weeks ago. The UK and Algeria will now form a strategic partnership bringing together senior security, military and intelligence advisors.
