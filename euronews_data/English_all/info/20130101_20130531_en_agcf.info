# ORIG CONTENT  Sweden won their ninth world title on home ice in Stockholm courtesy of a 5-1 demolition of surprise package Switzerland on Sunday. Switzerland fired out of the blocks and scored first after just under five minutes thanks to Roman Josi. Sweden were on level terms three minutes later when Erik Gustafsson latched on to a rebound and snapped a shot past Martin Gerber. The home crowd were on their feet again shortly afterwards when on-form Henrik Sedin batted home the second in midair. The Swedes broke the game open in the third when Simon Hjalmarsson made the most of a giveaway by Julien Vauclair. Loui Eriksson put the tie out of reach of the Swiss when a point shot went in off his skate. The Swiss pulled goalie Gerber for an extra skater late on but Sedin took full advantage to score his second on the night into the empty net sealing a 5-1 win and Sweden’s ninth gold at the worlds. Earlier in the day Team USA won the bronze medal match after a 3-2 shoot out victory over co-hosts Finland. The Americans started strongly and were soon two nil up thanks to first period goals from Craig Smith and captain Paul Stastny. The Finns picked up the pace in the second period but it wasn’t until the third period that the game really came alive thanks to two goals from Lauri Korpikoski that tied the game. After a goalless extra time the two teams went to a shoot out where Alex Galchenyuk scored the decisive goal for the USA who won their first medal since another bronze in the 2004 edition.
