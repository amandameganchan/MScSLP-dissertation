# ORIG CONTENT  Accustomed to sleeping under the stars, Christopher Knight, the man dubbed the “North Pond Hermit” is now behind bars in the US following his arrest for theft. The 47-year-old from Maine lived for 27 years in the wild by stealing food from local camps. Police have said the number of break-ins could be over a thousand and have been searching for him for years. He claims that the brush with the law was his first human contact since 1990. His solitary life unraveled when he triggered a motion sensor at a children’s camp where he allegedly stole hundreds of dollars worth of supplies. He has been charged with one count of burglary but other charges may follow.
