# ORIG TITLE    Palestinians mark ‘Nakba’ . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A huge stage has been erected in Ramalla in the West Bank – the centrepiece of the town’s efforts to mark ‘Nakba’. Simple theatre recreates the events of the1948 ‘Nakba’ when Palestinians either left or were forced to leave their homes. More rallies are to be held later all over the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Thousands are expected to attended this annual day of sadness. Meanwhile security was tight in Jerusalem as this year ‘Nakba’ coincides with the Jewish fesitival of Sahvuot – the day God gave the Torah to the Hebrew people. Many Jewish residents of the old city left for the day, after studying the Torah throughout the night. In the run up to both events, Palestinian youths once again clashed with Israeli security forces. The fate of the refugees and what they call their ‘right of return’ is an explosive issue still looming large.
