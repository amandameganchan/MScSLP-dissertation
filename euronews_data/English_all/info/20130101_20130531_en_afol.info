# ORIG CONTENT  Jerusalem’s leading Muslim cleric Sheikh Mohammed Hussein has been released without charge after six hours of questioning by Israeli police. The Grand Mufti of the city, Hussein was detained in relation to violence that broke out between Palestinians and Israelis outside the al-Aqsa mosque on May 7. Israeli police say the incident started when they detained a man who wanted to enter the plaza around the mosque, but refused to present his identity card. Muslim worshippers then threw chairs at Jewish visitors, according to police. The mosque overlooks Jerusalem’s Western Wall – a source of tension between the Jewish and Muslim communities in the city.
