# ORIG TITLE    Protesters clash with police at Syrian refugee camp in Turkey . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Syrian refugees at Turkey’s Suleiman Shah relief camp have clashed with police during demonstrations over their living conditions. Young protesters ran around the camp throwing stones. Turkish police used tear gas and water cannon to break up the crowd. They are conflicting views about how the unrest started. Some of the camp residents say it was triggered by a fire caused by a faulty power line. Three teenagers were injured in the blaze. But Turkish officials say the reason for the protest was residents’ outrage at 200 Syrians being turned away as they tried to get in. The camp already provides accommodation for some 35,000 refugees, as Syrians continue to flood over the border to escape the violence at home.
