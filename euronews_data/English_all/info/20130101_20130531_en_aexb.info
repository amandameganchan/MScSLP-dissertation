# ORIG TITLE    Hong Kong dockers strike over pay . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A strike by Hong Kong dock workers has entered its 26th day with no end in sight. The dockers say their pay has remained unchanged for ten years and are seeking a 20 per cent rise from contractors who supply workers for the port. Having rejected a seven per cent offer both sides appear as far apart as ever.
