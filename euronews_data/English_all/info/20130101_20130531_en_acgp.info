# ORIG TITLE    Greece back on track after 24-hour stoppage . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Normal service has resumed in Greece, after tens of thousands took to the streets on Wednesday in a nationwide protest against austerity. The two biggest unions brought most of the country to a standstill with the 24-hour stoppage. Swingeing wage cuts and tax hikes mean these are people who feel they have nothing more to lose. “As long as we fight,” said one man in the crowd, “then there is still hope for the future. This is to let them know they need to change their policies. If we don’t put up a fight, then there is no future.” . Masks from the group “Anonymous” lent transnational overtones to the protest, which got as far as the Greek parliament. The crowd made their feelings clear. “I can’t make ends meet,” a woman told reporters. “I don’t know what else we can do but protest. Living standards have been reduced to the level where we cannot survive.” . In Athens, riot police fired tear gas after they were showered with bottles and rocks. But around most of Greece, the protests passed off peacefully.
