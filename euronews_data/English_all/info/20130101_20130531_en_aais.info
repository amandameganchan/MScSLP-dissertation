# ORIG TITLE    Syria: Iranian prisoners freed . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Forty-eight Iranian hostages have been set free by Syrian rebels. They were released in exchange for 2,130 civilian prisoners held by the Syrian government. The Iranians were seized in early August by rebel forces who accused them of being members of Iran’s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps sent to fight for the regime. Iran, one of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s closest allies, denied that saying they were Shi’ite Muslims visiting shrines. The Turkish aid agency which helped broker the deal said the prisoners have now been taken to Damascus accompanied by Syrian and Iranian officials.
