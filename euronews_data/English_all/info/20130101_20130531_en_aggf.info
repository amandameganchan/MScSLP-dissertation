# ORIG TITLE    UEFA increase sanctions to combat racism . 
# ORIG CONTENT  European football’s governing body UEFA has toughened up it’s stance on racism within the game and introduced a minimum 10 match ban for any players or officials found guilty of racist abuse. The stricter disciplinary regulations were rubber stamped by UEFA’s executive committee on Thursday in London ahead of the Champions League final on Saturday. UEFA general secretary Gianni Infantino said: “I think the message is we are fighting against racism and we do it in an efficient way, and if a player or club offical is behaving in a racist way then they;ll be banned for 10 matches.” . Clubs would also face partial closure of stadiums for a first incident of racist abuse by fans and a full closure for a second offence. The new sanctions only apply to matches in European competition although UEFA is hoping domestic leagues will adopt the same punishments soon.
