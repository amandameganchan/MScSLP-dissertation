# ORIG TITLE    New coronavirus may be contagious from human to human . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The World Health Organisation has said that there is increasing evidence to suggest that the coronavirus can be passed between people in close contact, although it appears unlikely that the disease is generally contagious. Assistant Director General at the WHO (World Health Organisation), Keiji Fukuda, said: “This pattern of person to person transmission has remained limited to small clusters and so far there is no evidence that this virus has the capacity to sustain generalised community transmission.” . Nevertheless, governments around the world are advising citizens to take extra care. Official advice includes frequent hand washing, and when travelling to affected areas, particularly Saudi Arabia, avoiding contact with animals and with humans displaying signs of the disease. The virus causes flu-like symptoms and pneumonia and can lead to kidney failure. So far, there have been 18 confirmed deaths out of 33 confirmed cases in Saudi Arabia and Jordan spreading to Germany, the UK and France. Coronavirus is related to the SARS virus and can affect both animals and humans.
