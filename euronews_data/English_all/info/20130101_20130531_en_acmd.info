# ORIG CONTENT  Etam has shown their lingerie collection at Paris Fashion Week. Russian supermodel Natalia Vodianova is the face of Etam and also designing a lingerie collection each season. She says her designs encompass both fashion and comfort: “You know it’s a different kind of comfort. Physically it’s really important but then feeling empowered by lingerie is also really important, that’s a comfort for a women when she goes out and socializes, so both things have to be taken into consideration. Lingerie appears to be one sector in which the rish at least, are certainly not practicing austerity. Laurent Milchior, the Managing Director of Etam said: “Yes, the market has contracted and the market outlook for clothing is fragile. A new report came out yesterday which said that French consumers are still cutting their budgets and clothing is an area in which they are likely to cut back. So we need to – all of us need to – improve our marketing and our offers. We need to create a radically different shopping experience, a different value to the product. That’s going to be absolutely essential in the years to come. Didier Grumbach, the President of the French Couture Federation, said: “Middle market brands are suffering, that’s sure. Top end brands with an international market presence are, on the other hand, in a phase of growth unlike anything we’ve ever seen. We’ve never seen growth like it, up to 40% per year, sometimes triple in a year – absolutely extraordinary growth.” .
