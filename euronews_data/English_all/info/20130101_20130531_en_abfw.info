# ORIG TITLE    PKK ‘to cease hostilities’ in February, says Turkish paper . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A report in the mainstream Turkish newspaper Hurriyet claims Kurdish militants are ready to stop hostilities next month under a fledgling peace process. Intelligence officials began talks with jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan late last year, and the paper says preliminary talks with other members have also been held in northern Iraq. The report says around 100 fighters will hand in their weapons and leave Turkey in the spring. The paper did not identify its sources but is seen as authoritative on security-related matters. Last month Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan revealed that intelligence officials were holding talks with Ocalan. Under the process, the Turkish government is said to be ready to introduce reforms to improve the rights of minority Kurds.
