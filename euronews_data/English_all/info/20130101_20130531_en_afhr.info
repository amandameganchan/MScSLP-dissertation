# ORIG TITLE    Former pope Benedict moves back into the Vatican . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Two months after his resignation Pope Emeritus Benedict is to move back into the Vatican. Benedict whose former name was Joseph Ratzinger has been living in the papal summer residence of Castel Gandolfo since he became the first pope in modern history to abdicate. He’s been there while his apartment was being renovated. His return could present problems for his successor Pope Francis as it will be the first time a reigning pope and a retired one will be living within the Vatican walls. Some scholars worry that if Francis undoes some of his predecessor’s policies while he is still alive, the former pope could become a catalyst for conservatives and split the Church. However, the former pope has admitted he is in failing health and has promised to live quietly in retirement and not interfere.
