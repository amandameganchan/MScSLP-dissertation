# ORIG CONTENT  In the United States, three young women who have been missing for more than a decade have been found alive. Amanda Berry and Gina De Jesus were teenagers when they disappeared within a year of each other in Cleveland, Ohio. Police also found Michelle Knight who was 20-years old when she vanished. A neighbour, Charles Ramsey, who helped them escape said one had a child: “I see this girl going nuts trying to get outside,” he said, adding that he was astonished when she identified herself. “Then I realized I’m calling 911 for Amanda Berry. I thought that girl was dead,” he said. He said Berry had emerged from the house “with a little girl.” . Relatives have expressed their shock and surprise that the women were found in a house a few blocks away from where they had been abducted. All three women are being treated in a local hospital and are said to be “safe” and “in a fair condition.” . Three brothers, who are all in their fifties, are now in police custody. It is believed one of them lived in the house from which the women escaped.
