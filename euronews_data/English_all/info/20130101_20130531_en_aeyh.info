# ORIG CONTENT  At least 82 people have been killed and at least 200 others are injured after an eight-storey building collapsed near the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka.

Watch the video . A local official says a crack in the building, housing garment factories and a shopping centre, was detected on Tuesday but factory owners ignored a warning to close their businesses. Building collapses are common in impoverished Bangladesh as most defy the governmentâ€™s construction code to construct multi-storey buildings. Relatives of the victims have gathered at the scene to search for their loved ones. Firefighters and army personnel are working frantically to rescue people from the wreckage. With many still trapped inside, the number of fatalities is likely to rise. More than 70 people were killed after a multi-storey garment factory collapsed in the same area in 2005. In November at least 13 people were killed after an under-constructed flyover broke down in the port city of Chittagong.
