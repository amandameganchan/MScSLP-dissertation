# ORIG TITLE    Pakistan’s Ashraf claims progress after five years in power . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf has bid farewell to the Pakistani people in his final televised address before leaving office. His government was the first to complete its full five-year term in the country’s history, and a caretaker government now steers the county until elections in no more than 90 days. Ashraf claimed he had launched economic reforms, raised state worker’s salaries, and launched development projects. However some people said they were glad to see the back of Ashraf’s Pakistani People’s Party. “Vote for them again? God forbid! What are you talking about? We tried them for five years. Isn’t that enough? Anyone who votes for them again is either a fool, or will do so for selfish reasons. Anyone who care for this country will never vote for them again,” said grocer Gul Mohammad. “The past five years have given us nothing but inflation, worries and unemployment. They created all sorts of problems for the masses. They have wrecked every organization. They have destroyed everything,” said cable operator Shakir Hussain. Of immediate concern are power cuts, an economy that is likely to need another big IMF loan soon, and terrorist and sectarian violence.
