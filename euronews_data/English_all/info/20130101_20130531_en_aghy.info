# ORIG CONTENT  Explosions and gunfire rocked the Afghan capital on Friday as the Taliban launched a coordinated attack on a UN compound used by the CIA. A suicide car-bomb blast was followed by several other explosions as the militants exchanged gunfire with Afghan troops supported by Norwegian special forces. A Taliban spokesman said the attack was aimed at foreigners who were training Afghan security members. There was no immediate report of casualties. One witness told how security cameras helped him escape: “An explosion happened, and when it happened I went to my office to check the security cameras and I saw four people running to the site. When I saw the four attackers we quickly got out of there in case they came in,” said a local restaurant owner. The Taliban announced a ‘Spring Offensive’ in April saying it would target foreign military bases and diplomatic areas. Concern is mounting about how the 350,000 members of the Afghan security forces will cope with the militants after most foreign NATO-led combat troops have left by the end of next year.
