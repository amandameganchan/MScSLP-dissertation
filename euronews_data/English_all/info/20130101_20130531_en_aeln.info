# ORIG TITLE    French Senate approves same-sex marriage bill . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The French Senate has said ‘I do’ to gay marriage, but the battle rumbles on. The bill was voted through with only minor amendments. By law it must now face a second reading at the National Assembly which is expected next Wednesday. France remains divided on an issue that has led to many mass protests. Jean-Pierre Raffarin, Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) Senator, who is against the bill has not given up hope. François Rebsamen, a Socialist party Senator points out that the opposition is standing on the wrong side of history. The debate now goes to the streets, as opponents have announced demonstrations for the end of May.
