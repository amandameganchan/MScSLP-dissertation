# ORIG TITLE    Hungary court overturns ban on Nazi and Communist symbols . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The decision by Hungaryâ€™s Constitutional Court to reject a ban on Nazi and Communist symbols has been deemed unworkable by several political groups. Some socialists say a constitutional amendment may be needed to prevent anyone from sporting a swastika, red star or SS badge, which Hungarian Jews or surviving victims could justly find offensive.
