# ORIG CONTENT  Gunmen have surrounded Libya’s justice ministry in the capital of Tripoli. Men in pick-up trucks with anti-aircraft guns asked officials to leave the building, to which they promptly complied. The militia are calling for former aides to deposed leader, Muammar Gaddafi, to be barred from government posts. The General National Congress has postponed a decision on the issue to Sunday. Ibrahim Al-Mesalaty, a protester and former rebel says their message is clear: “Our demands are for the (enactment of the) Political Isolation Law and to clean up the justice system and all state institutions and ministries.” . “The actual Justice Minister used to be the teacher of Aicha el Gaddafi (Gadaffi’s daughter). He was a law teacher…he used to work for the old regime and now he’s part of the current one,” another protester added . The Foreign Ministry was also encircled by gunmen on Sunday and other state buildings have been targeted. The rise in armed protests has led to increased security fears in the Libyan capital. The German embassy has already suspended some of its activities.
