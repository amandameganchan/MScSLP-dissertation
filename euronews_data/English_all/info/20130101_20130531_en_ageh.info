# ORIG CONTENT  Emergency workers have been searching for survivors after a tornado ripped through a suburb of Oklahoma city in the US. Officials have now lowered the number of deaths thought to have been caused by the storm. Twenty-four bodies are said to have been recovered. But there is a warning that more could be found. Thunderstorms and lightning have been slowing the rescue effort. The three kilometre wide twister, with winds of up to 320 kilometres per hour, flattened large swathes of Moore – destroying everything in its path. The Plaza Towers Elementary School took a direct hit, its roof was ripped off and its walls collapsed. Another school and a hospital were among the other buildings levelled in Moore, which is home to around 50 thousand people. The area was given a 16 minute warning before the tornado touched down on Monday afternoon. US President Barack Obama has declared a major disaster in Oklahoma and has offered federal aid to boost state and local recovery efforts. USA’s deadliest tornadoes .
