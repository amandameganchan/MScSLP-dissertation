# ORIG CONTENT  The mother of the Tsarnaev brothers has pleaded her sons’ innocence saying they have been framed for the marathon bombings in Boston. She said neither of them had given any indication that they were extremists: . “It is really, really a hard thing to hear. And being a mother, what I can say is that I am really sure, I am like a hundred percent sure that this is a set-up. “My two sons are really innocent, and I know that neither of them never, never has talked about whatever they are saying about now.” . “And he (Tamerlan) . never, he never told me that he would be, like, on a side of jihad. And whatever they are talking, whatever is being talked about him being a loser, they are themselves the losers. My son would never do this. It is a set-up.” . Innocent . “He (Tamerlan) . was controlled by the FBI, like, for three to five years. They knew what my son was doing, they knew what sites on the Internet he was going to. They used to come home, they used to come and talk to me, they used to tell me that, you know, that they are controlling him… They were telling me he is really a leader and they are afraid of him.” . “How could this happen? How could they… They were controlling every step of him. they are telling today that this is a terrorist act. Never ever – this is not true. My two sons are innocent.” . “My sons, my oldest son used to tell me everything, everything. Every day, every second day my son used to call me and ask me, how are you mama, both of them, mama we love you, mama how are you, we miss you. “It’s impossible, impossible for them, for both of them to do such thing. So I’m really, really, really, really telling that this is a set-up. “My sons would tell me, my sons would never keep it a secret, so I would know. So if anyone who would know it would be me.” .
