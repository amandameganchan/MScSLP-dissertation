# ORIG CONTENT  Moscow has reacted angrily to the levy on bank accounts in Cyprus. President Vladimir Putin says it is “unfair and sets a dangerous precedent,” and the country’s Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev, also spoke out against it: . “We should say this directly,” he said. “This simply looks like the confiscation of other people’s money. I do not know who the author of this idea is, but this is what it looks like. We are unfortunately acquainted with such practices from Soviet times.” . Russian citizens account for the majority of the billions of euros deposited and Russian banks are also heavily exposed to the island as a offshore centre for big business and many ordinary Russian citizens also have their money in Cypriot banks. Uniastrum Bank customer Lyubov said: . “When I heard about it, my first thought was of course ‘oh God, I have money there!‘ And I got scared, really scared.” . Almost half of the money held by non-residents in Cyprus is believed to come from Russians. At the end of last year Moody’s credit-rating agency put the amount deposited by Russian banks and corporations at around 24 billion euros.
