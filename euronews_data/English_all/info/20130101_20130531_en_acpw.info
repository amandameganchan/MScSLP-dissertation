# ORIG TITLE    The serious side of the Harlem Shake . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The Harlem Shake – the latest dance craze to go viral – is still going strong. The latest version – filmed on a flight from Colorado Springs to San Diego – has been viewed close to half a million times on YouTube. However, not everyone was amused and investigators from the US Federal Aviation Administratio have launched a probe to decide whether the dancing students broke any flight safety rules. The plane’s operators Frontier Airlines said at the time the dance took place the seatbelt sign was off and safety measures were followed. In the Middle East, the dance has been used as part of a political statement. Chanting “Leave! Leave!” protesters jiggled about outside the headquarters of Egypt’s President Mohamed Morsi’s Muslim Brotherhood party. About 400 young men let their moves do most of the talking in Cairo as they showed just how they feel about the Islamist president.
