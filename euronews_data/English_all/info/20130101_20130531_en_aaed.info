# ORIG TITLE    Gaza gears up for Fatah anniversary celebrations . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Palestinian party Fatah will celebrate its anniversary in Gaza for the first time since rival group Hamas seized power in the region. On Thursday, Fatah founder Abdul Aziz Shaheen, known as Abu Ali, entered Gaza for the first time in more than five years. His visit came ahead of Friday’s official celebrations to mark the party’s creation 48 years ago. Events will include cultural performances and a recorded speech by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Fatah is the largest group in the Palestinian Liberation Organisation. It emerged from the conflict with Israel on January 1, 1964. The recent upgrading of the Palestinians’ diplomatic standing by the United Nations has given many renewed confidence in their ongoing fight for an independent state.
