# ORIG TITLE    Thousands join anti-gay marriage protest in Paris . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Demonstrators filled the streets of Paris on Sunday, to show their opposition to a draft law which would allow same-sex couples to marry and adopt children. France’s lower house of parliament has approved the “marriage for everyone” bill with a large majority. The Senate is due to vote on the legislation next month. Both houses are dominated by French President Francois Hollande’s Socialist Party and its allies. “It’s the Senators’ time. They are competent lawmakers and they can totally see that there are lots of shortcomings in this bill and lots of unmanageable complications for society. We ask them to be responsible,” said Tugdual Derville, a demonstration spokesman. Protester Victoire Ponroy added: “We think that a man and a woman are complementary. If a child is raised by two men or two women, obviously they will be loved, obviously they will be raised properly, but they will lack something fundamental for his upbringing.” . Polls show a shrinking majority of French voters backing same-sex marriage, which is already legal in about a dozen, mostly European nations and some US states.
