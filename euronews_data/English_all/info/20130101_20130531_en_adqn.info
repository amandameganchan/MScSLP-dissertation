# ORIG TITLE    “Yo Joe”, the G.I.s are back on the big screen . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The G.I. Joes are back in the cinema, in GI Joe Retaliation, starring Bruce Willis and Dwayne Johnson. It is an action packed adventure that sees them not only fighting their mortal enemy Cobra; but contending with threats from within the government that jeopardise their very existence. Director Jon M. Chu said he wanted to bring in fresh talent this time round: “I think that’s part of the tradition of G.I. Joe, to constantly re-invent it, whether it was the cartoon, to the toy line, to the comic book, to the first movie. In that tradition, and I love getting in there and giving it a little more grit. We really wanted you to feel the power of the punch, and of course when you bring in Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson, you bring in Bruce Willis, you bring Channing back, and you mix them all up, there’s a fun element of adventure in that.” .
