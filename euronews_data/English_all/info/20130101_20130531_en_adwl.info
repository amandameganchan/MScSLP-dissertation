# ORIG CONTENT  A chainsaw-wielding thief has broken into a Paris museum and cut off the tusk of an elephant, which once belonged to King Louis XIV of France. According to officials, a man was later arrested in a nearby street and a three kilogram piece of tusk was recovered. “Elephant ivory isn’t worth more than about 10 euros per kilo. Its historical value is more important, that can’t be estimated,” said Jacques Cuisin, from the Paris Natural History Museum. The tusks attached to the elephant skeleton are not the original ones, they were added in the 19th century. There have been a number of thefts of ivory from European museums and zoos in recent years.
