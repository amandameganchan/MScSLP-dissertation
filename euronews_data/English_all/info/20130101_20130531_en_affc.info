# ORIG TITLE    US and South Korea end eight weeks of joint military exercises . 
# ORIG CONTENT  South Korea and the United States have completed a series of joint military drills. The two-month-long ‘Foal Eagle’ exercise involved thousands of air, ground and naval personal. The military movements along with fresh UN sanctions have infuriated North Korea and led to increased tension on the Korean peninsula. A spokesperson for the South Korean Defense Ministry said: . “South Korea and the US will continue to observe North Korea’s possible provocations including the missile launches and other movements.” . After weeks of threats from Pyongyang it appears that a situation of relative calm has returned to the region. Still a joint US-South Korean summit in Washington in May could well lead to a further bout of bellicose rhetoric from the North.
