# ORIG TITLE    Kate Nash Goes It Alone . 
# ORIG CONTENT  After her international debut in 2007, Kate Nash has become known for her signature plucky style. But after three-years dabbling in charity, films and feminist advocacy, she’s back with something different for her third album: ‘Girl Talk’. Finally daring to indulge herself in her long-standing love for punk music, Nash is excited by the combination with her usual folky rhythms: . “I think it’s different to my other stuff…it’s very raw, it’s sort of, I play bass, everything I wrote on the base basically, already straight away without even any of the other production. It has a tougher punk feel to it. It’s still a pop record because I love pop melodies.” . After a fall-out over the would-be lyrics of her new album, the Brit School graduate left Fiction Records in 2011 in order to set up her own label. Despite initial fears, Nash acknowledges that going-it alone has proved liberating: . “ I got dropped from my label last summer and that was kind of scary I think, but actually for only a couple of days because it quickly turned around into being an exciting prospect because I’m lucky to be in the position I am on my third record (…)It feels great to be outside that sort of major record label environment where I feel there’s a dark cloud over a lot of people and frustration, and there’s boss upon boss upon boss, pressure upon pressure upon pressure…you just lose creative control.” . Kate Nash is currently touring her new ‘garage punk’ sound – already compared by some to Courtney Love – around the US and the UK now. ‘Girl Talk’ is available on the artist’s very own label, Have 10p Records.
