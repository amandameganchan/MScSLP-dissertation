# ORIG CONTENT  The Repsol Honda team unveiled it’s new bikes for the start of the 2013 Moto GP season. Casey Stoner has retired so the 2012 World Champion runner up Dani Pedrosa will be joined by compatriot Marc Marquez who has made the step up from Moto2 where he was world champion. Honda took the constructors crown last season but the new bikes are by no means set up for 2013. “There is still a lot of work to do on the bike. The rules have changed a bit and we have to refine every detail before the first race,” explained Dani Pedrosa. His fellow rider Marc Marquez is looking forward to his first season in the top formula. “Everything is new to me but the structure which was in place for Casey Stoner and the team’s experience can be very good for me,” he said. Pedrosa and Marquez will have their first outing of 2013 on the bikes when the team goes to Malaysia for testing sessions ahead of the opening Grand Prix in Qatar in April.
