# ORIG TITLE    Bahrain Grand Prix protestors: ‘Don’t race on our blood’ . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Thousands of protesters have blocked a motorway in Bahrain ahead of the Grand Prix on Sunday. Carrying banners that say ‘don’t race on our blood’, they are calling on the Formula 1 bosses to cancel the race due to the poor human rights record of their government. Burning tyres lit by protesters blocked roads, and police responded with tear gas. But there are no indications the event will be called off. The race was cancelled two years ago during demonstrations which led to 50 deaths and hundreds of arrests.
