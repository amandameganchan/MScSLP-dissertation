# ORIG TITLE    Pakistan: Karachi residents strike following latest bomb blast . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Karachi residents called on the government to do do more to combat militants as they sifted through the debris of another deadly bomb blast in Pakistan. The attack on Sunday March 3, outside a Shi’ite Mosque, killed at least 45 people in the commercial capital and wounded around 150 more. The following day shops and businesses across the city closed in protest. “What is the government waiting for?” asked one shop owner. “The army, or whoever is supposed to take action, should act. This process that has started all over Pakistan and Quetta is not going to stop unless high level operations are carried out against them.” . Bombings in Quetta alone have killed nearly 200 people since the start of the year. Another Karachi resident complained: “We don’t know what’s become of this country. The government is quiet. It’s standing around like a spectator. You are seeing what’s happening to Muslims. People are leaving their homes and not knowing if they’ll return.” . Military offensives and US drone strikes have reduced suicide bombings on government and military targets recently. But Sunni groups have escalated strikes against Shi’ites who they consider non-Muslim.
