# ORIG TITLE    Russia bans smoking in a variety of public places from June 1 . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Just one day after World No Tobacco Day, a ban in Russia will mean no smoking in certain public areas. From June 1, no one will be allowed to light up in a number of places including schools, government buildings and lifts. The ban also stops people from smoking close to certain locations – such as within 15 metres of the entrance to a underground railway station. Enforcing the law will be hard according to First Deputy of the State Duma Committee for Healthcare Nikolay Gerasimenko. “It’s impossible for a policeman to stand next to everyone. People will have to speak to smokers themselves, or make a phone call to the police,” said Gerasimenko. People will still be able to puff away in places like restaurants, bars and on long-distance train journeys for another year, when further restrictions will take effect. Recent statistics show Russia has one of the highest smoking rates in the world.
