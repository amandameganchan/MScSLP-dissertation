# ORIG TITLE    Musharraf back in Pakistan after ending exile . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Pakistanâ€™s former President Pervez Musharraf has arrived back in the country after nearly four years of self-imposed exile and a Taliban threat to kill him. The former army general resigned in 2008 when his allies lost a vote and a new government threatened him with impeachment. He hopes, however, to regain influence and run in a general election in May. But Musharraf faces charges of failing to provide adequate security to former prime minister Benazir Bhutto before her assassination in 2007. He also faces charges in connection with the death of a Baluch separatist leader.
