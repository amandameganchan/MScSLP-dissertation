# ORIG TITLE    White House consults all sides in gun debate . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Efforts to increase gun controls in the US are gathering pace with the White House initiating a series of meetings. Yesterday it was the turn of anti-gun activists, today the National Rifle Association representing four million members will be consulted. The aim is to build a political consensus on possible restrictions. Vice President Joe Biden is heading a consultative panel: . “The president and I are determined to take action. This is not an exercise in photo opportunities. There are executive orders, executive action that can be taken. We haven’t decided what that is yet, but we are compiling it all with the help of the Attorney General and all the rest of the cabinet members as well as legislative action we believe is required.” . December’s shooting of 20 children and six adults in a Connecticut elementary school has intensified the weapons debate. Biden’s group is expected among other steps to recommend a reinstatement of an assault weapons ban which expired in 2004 and a data base of multiple arms sales.
