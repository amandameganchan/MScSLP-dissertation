# ORIG CONTENT  The stars were out in LA for the 22nd annual MTV Movie Awards. From ‘Best Shirtless Performance’ to ‘Best WTF Moment’, the irreverent show did not disappoint the young audience. Hollywood heartthrob Brad Pitt was on hand to announce one of the big winners of the night – Marvel’s ‘The Avengers’. Starring Robert Downey Jr and Scarlett Johannsson, it took home three gongs for ‘Movie of the Year’, ‘Best Villain’ and ‘Best Fight’. The other big prizewinner was ‘Silver Linings Playbook’ starring Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence who won the ‘Best Male’ and ‘Best Female Performance’ awards. Lawrence will have to make room on her mantelpiece next to the Oscar she won for the same role. The chemistry between the pair also landed them the title of ‘Best Kiss’. Australian actress Rebel Wilson hosted the awards in her signature sassy style, and she did not go home empty handed. She took the awards for ‘Best Breakthrough Performance’ and ‘Best Musical Moment’ for her part in musical comedy ‘Pitch Perfect’.
