Human Rights Watch want the IOC to stand by one of its maxims, to celebrate human dignity and demand the Russian authorities end the abuses. The Mayor of Sochi is Anatoly Pakhomov: “I will tell you there were two complaints to the mayor’s office during all this time. Therefore, to me this mass abuse of labour law that you mention, the mass abuse is unknown to me.” . Russian President Vladimir Putin sees Sochi as prestige project for his country that will allow him to showcase Russia’s ability to host global events.
