# ORIG CONTENT  Police investigating a multiple shooting in the southern Swiss village of Daillon say it is unclear why the gunman opened fire – killing three women and injuring two men. The shooter, said to be a local resident, used at least two weapons during the rampage late on Wednesday. According to officials, he started firing at people from his apartment before moving into the street. Police say the man was in pyschiatric care seven years ago. “He was known to our services as a result of weapons being seized in 2005. And also for another reason – drug use. But he did not have any convictions,” said Robert Steiner, a police commander. The deadly shooting is likely to stir a fresh debate about Switzerland’s liberal firearms laws. In 2011, voters – backed by the government – rejected proposals to tighten legislation. Daillon is close to the town of Sion, the capital of the Valais region – known for its world-class ski resorts.
