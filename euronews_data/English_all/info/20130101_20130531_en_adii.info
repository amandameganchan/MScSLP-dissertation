# ORIG TITLE    Halle Berry takes it to the wire in thriller The Call . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Halle Berry lit up the Hollywood red carpet at the premiere of her new kidnap thriller “The Call” in Los Angeles earlier this month. She plays a tough emergency operator trying to save a young kidnap victim who has dialled 911. The 46-year-old actress, who won an Academy Award in 2001 for Monster’s Ball and starred in hits like Die Another Day, features this time alongside Abigail Breslin. “Yeah, as a woman, this is a movie for women, a movie about women empowering themselves,” Berry said. “But if you are a woman and you have a child or a young girl, you won’t quite move in the world the same way after seeing this movie. You’ll have things on your mind, you’ll have thoughts about if you were to get abducted or find yourself in a situation, you’ll know some things you can do. You won’t feel quite so defenseless after you see this movie.” . The 16-year-old Abigail Breslin is already something of a veteran. She was in the 2006 comedy-drama road movie Little Miss Sunshine, but she said acting with Halle Berry was a highlight. “Well she’s incredible,” Breslin said. “She’s such an amazing actress and an amazing woman. So to be able to work with her was incredible and you know just watching her and seeing her on set – she’s so professional and so sweet to everybody, so I think I probably just picked up some stuff subconsciously from her hopefully.” . The Call also stars Morris Chestnut, Michael Eklund and Jennifer Hudson’s fiance, David Otunga.
