# ORIG CONTENT  The Syrian Air Force is deliberately targeting civilians as well as launching indiscriminate attacks against non combatants, according to Human Rights Watch. Its findings are published in a report titled “Death from the Skies”. The New York based non-governmental organisation visited 52 sites in Syria and uncovered 59 such attacks, which Human Rights Watch says are serious violations of international law. Ole Solvang, an emergencies researcher at Human Rights Watch, said: “The fact that one hospital has been attacked eight times, clearly shows that this was a deliberate attack on the hospital.” . According to the report, Syrian aircraft attack areas where the civilian population are likely to gather, bread queues are a frequent target. Ole Solvang continued: “One of the attacks was the August 2012 attack on the Arqiol Bakery in Aleppo City. It was only when people starting gathering outside the bakery that the helicopter dropped two bombs that killed almost two dozen people.” . Human Rights Watch criticised the role of Russia and China in blocking any firm action against Damascus. The report comes as the G8 meeting of foreign ministers in London condemned the number of fatalities in Syria’s two year conflict.
