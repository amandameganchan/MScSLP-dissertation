# ORIG CONTENT  There was support on the streets of Tunis as thousands voiced their backing for the country’s governing Islamist party Ennahda. Despite that Prime Minister Hamadi Jebali has issued an ultimatum to politicians. He has said his threatened resignation will take effect this week if his proposals for an interim government of technocrats are not met. It comes amidst mounting anger against France as teacher Fathi Rhayem one of the protesters explained. “The regimes of Ben Ali and Bourguiba, which are characterised by a submission to France, are over now. What we need is a balanced relationship. We want economical and friendly relations with France but we do not want to be dictated to.” . Following the killing of opposition leader Chokri Belaid whose funeral was last Friday French Interior Minister Manuel Valls said it was an attack on the values of Tunisia’s Jasmine revolution. That was evidence the former colonial power was interfering say protesters. Meanwhile the widow of Chokri Belaid has gone on television and asked Tunisia’s government for official protection for her family.
