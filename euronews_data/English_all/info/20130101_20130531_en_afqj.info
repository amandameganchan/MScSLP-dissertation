# ORIG CONTENT  US Secretary of State John Kerry has indicated that Washington is keen to revive Israeli-Palestinian peace talks within a short time frame. It came as he announced his fourth visit to the region this year. Kerry is expected to meet separately with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas later this month. “We’re working with a short time span. We understand an imperative to try to have some sense of direction as rapidly as we can,” said Kerry. President Barack Obama discussed regional security and Middle East peace with Netanyahu during a telephone conversation on Wednesday. According to the White House, they agreed to continue close cooperation on a range of issues. Israeli-Palestinian peace talks collapsed in 2010, in a dispute over continued Israeli building of Jewish settlements on West Bank land, which Palestinians want for a state.
