# ORIG TITLE    Egypt: arrest warrant for satirical TV host . 
# ORIG CONTENT  In Egypt, the public prosecutor has issued an arrest warrant for the presenter of a popular satirical TV show for supposedly insulting Islam and the president Mohammed Mursi. Bassem Yousseff has lampooned many public figures on his show. He featured a clip of the president who included some English words in a speech and then mocked Mursi’s language skills. The presenter, who has been likened to the American satirist Jon Stewart, has attracted several complaints for his programme. Yousseff confirmed on his Twitter account that he was the subject of an arrest warrant. He said he would present himself at the prosecutor’s office on Sunday unless, he quipped, they decided to save him the trouble of travelling by sending a police car. The case has highlighted concerns about freedom of speech in Egypt under President Mursi’s rule.
