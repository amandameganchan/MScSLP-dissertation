# ORIG CONTENT  The eurozone has turned a page with the election of Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem as the new head of the Eurogroup. The 46-year-old replaces the outgoing Jean-Claude Juncker. Dijsselbloem wants the eurozone to continue with economic reforms and austerity measures aimed at resolving the debt crisis. But he said solidarity is also important: “Solidarity is at the top of my priority list and I’m convinced that working towards a sustainable budget, a balanced budget in different countries, doesn’t conflict with holding on to that solidarity.” . French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici voiced concerns about the new appointee, most notably about his level of experience. “This is important”, he says, “as a balanced model is needed to ensure stability throughout Europe. What I expect from the new president is that he is not the president of the triple A (countries) against the other, of the north against the south, of the virtuous countries against the others who are not, of the budgetary balance against growth. We must succeed in reconciling all these dimensions,” Moscovici said. Dijsselbloem, a centre-left stalwart, had only held the job as finance minister for six weeks before the call came from the Eurogroup.
