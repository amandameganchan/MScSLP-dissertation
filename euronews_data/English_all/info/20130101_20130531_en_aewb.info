# ORIG CONTENT  The surviving suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings , Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is said to have regained consciousness. The 19-year-old who is being treated for gunshot wounds to the throat and leg had been heavily sedated but is now apparently capable of responding in writing to questions. Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis had earlier spoken to reporters: “The suspect is in critical but stable condition. There is a special interrogation team from the Federal Bureau of Investigation standing by to talk to him. That hasn’t happened yet. Until it does and until the investigation moves forward we won’t know definitely what other things may come.” . Tsarnaev was wounded before his arrest after a massive manhunt following a shoot out with police in which his older brother died. Both young men are suspected of setting off the bombs which killed three people and injured over 170 others at the Boston Marathon. Federal prosecutors say they may seek the death penalty.
