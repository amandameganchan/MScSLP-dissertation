# ORIG TITLE    Central African Republic to get unity government . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A unity government in the Central African Republic could be formed on Saturday, after the signing of a formal ceasefire. Following three days of talks, the deal was signed in Gabon’s capital Libreville. It paves the way for rebels to join the new administration and for President François Bozizé to remain in power until the end of his term in 2016. Regional leaders helped to negotiate the terms, including the President of Chad Idriss Deby, who said: “The new transitional government which will be set up will need support and solidarity from us, the neighbours of the Central African Republic.” . Bozizé‘s supporters will be happy that the President will hang on to the job he has had for 10 years. The rebels had insisted he leave office. However, as agreed in the peace deal, a prime minister will be appointed from the opposition. Unrest began on December 10 after the Seleka Rebel Coalition accused Bozizé of failing to honour previous peace deals. Neighbouring African countries sent troops after the rebels captured many towns, falling just short of the capital Bangui.
