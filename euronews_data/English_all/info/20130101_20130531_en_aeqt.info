# ORIG CONTENT  Strong aftershocks have rocked Pakistan following the 7.8 magnitude earthquake registered in Iran on Tuesday. The Pakistani town of Mashkel has been ‘totally destroyed’ according to local media. Death tolls remain unclear in the remote border region, but Pakistan is reporting at least 39 dead and more than 170 injured. The epicentre of the quake which lasted 40 seconds was about 50 kilometres away from the Pakistani border near the Iranian town of Saravan. Iran appears to have backtracked on initial reports of 40 deaths, with state media reporting just a single death. Earthquake experts say that the depth of the epicentre could explain the lack of casualties in Iran. However, some suggest that one week after a 6.6 quake struck near a nuclear plant in Bushehr, authorities may be looking to downplay the damage.
