# ORIG TITLE    Tension increases after deaths of Indian soldiers . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Two Indian soldiers have been killed and one wounded in an alleged gunfight with troops from Pakistan. A spokesman for the Indian army claimed the body of one of the soldiers was found “badly mutilated” on Indian territory as tensions between the two countries heighten. Pakistan soldiers are accused of crossing the heavily militarised line dividing the disputed region of Kashmir which is claimed by both nations. “The potential for escalation is considerable because in the event that the Pakistani military has been taking the support of what we call the ‘Mujahid paltan’, a platoon of extremist militants, in many ways, this would be setting Indo-Pak relations back in a very, very irreparable manner,” explained Uday Bhaskar a defence strategy expert. Pakistan say India is trying to divert attention from an incident in which it alleges one of its solders was killed after an Indian incursion. Skirmishes between the two countries are common along what is known as the Line of Control despite a ceasefire. The area has been a flashpoint for 60 years.
