# ORIG TITLE    Croatia upgrades borders as it enters EU . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Upgrades on border lines and crossings are taking place as Croatia becomes the 28th member state of the European Union on July 1. The country has seen its border policeman triple to around 6,000, with a stricter form of passport and customs control. Josip Perkovic, a Croatian border policeman has witnessed these changes first hand. “In the last few years a lot has changed. We constantly get new vehicles and  equipment like thermal vision cameras,  binoculars, night vision devices, which are all essential for detecting illegal entries.” . Croatia’s main problem as it prepares to enter into the European Union is that it lies on the notorious ‘Balkan smuggling route’ used to ferry contraband drugs as well illegal immigrants from Africa and the Middle East into Western Europe. Although Croatia will not automatically join the EU’s passport-free Schengen zone on July 1, it is under pressure to meet with the criteria and achieve its goal in 2 years time.
