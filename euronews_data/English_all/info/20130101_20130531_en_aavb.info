# ORIG TITLE    Five militants captured alive at In Amenas . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Algerian security forces say they have captured five Islamic militants still alive in the In Amenas gas plant, but that three more are on the run. The discovery came as the Algerian army made its way through the vast complex, defusing mines left by the militants, and looking for more survivors. A Mauritanian news website has carried a video in which veteran jihadist Mokhtar Belmokhtar has claimed responsibility for the attack in the name of al-Qaeda. He called on France to end its air strikes in Mali. He claimed around 40 attackers were involved, mostly from Muslim countries, but that some were from the West.
