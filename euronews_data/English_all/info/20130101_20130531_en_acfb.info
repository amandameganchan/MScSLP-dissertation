# ORIG CONTENT  Less than a day after the spectacular diamond robbery at Brussels airport, two armed men held up the De Beers jewellery stand at a Paris department store. The pair made off with around 3 million euros in gems. Police said the robbers struck at around 6.45pm on Tuesday evening, demanding that two display cases be unlocked. “There were no gunshots, no-one was injured. But this is an important case, because we’re talking about several million euros of jewellery,” said police spokesman Christophe Crepin. The heist happened after French police figures showed a 61 percent increase in robberies against jewellers and goldsmiths between 2009 and 2011. Five years ago, more than 85 million euros in gems were stolen from another prestigious Parisian jeweller.
