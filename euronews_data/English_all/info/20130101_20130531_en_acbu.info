# ORIG TITLE    Rihanna shows RIver Island collection . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Pop star Rihanna has shown her debut collection for River Island at London Fashion Week. She said that the clothes would be worn by a girl full of personality and sass who also loves fashion. “Most love fashion and they want to express themselves through what they wear. That’s what I like to do”. Models strutted through a series of five square compartments, pausing in each to showcase midriff-baring mesh tops and yellow shift dresses. Denim tank tops were teamed with slouchy jeans, while thigh-high slits featured heavily in the figure-hugging dresses and  monochrome skirts. Vogue magazine noted that Rihanna didn’t actually design the clothes. The singer collaborated with designer Adam Selman via email and phone calls and then attended fittings after samples were made.
