# ORIG TITLE    Greek prison hostage drama: murderer ‘has explosives’ . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A convicted Albanian murderer has taken hostages in a Greek prison and is threatening to blow himself up if he is not allowed to escape. Alket Rijai has already grabbed the headlines twice with jailbreaks involving helicopters in 2006 and 2009. Police say he claims to have hand grenades and a quantity of plastic explosive. He reportedly barricaded himself into part of the Malandrino jail in central Greece with around five guards. At least two other prisoners were with Rijai, but it was not clear if they were hostages or accomplices, an official added. The last time he got away, in 2009, a helicopter flew over a high-security prison in Athens, lowered a ladder and whisked him and an accomplice off the roof as guards looked on. The helicopter pilot later said he had been hijacked. Rijai was arrested a few months after his second escape while sleeping in a hideout in a village northeast of the Greek capital.
