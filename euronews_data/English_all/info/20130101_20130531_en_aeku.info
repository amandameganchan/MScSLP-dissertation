# ORIG CONTENT  The crises in Syria and North Korea are set to be top the agenda at a pre-G8 summit meeting in London on Wednesday and Thursday. British Foreign Secretary William Hague is hosting the foreign ministers from Canada, France Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia and the United States, ahead of the official meeting in Northern Ireland in two months time. Following rising tensions in the Korean peninsula, Hague said the group will be talking about preventing or resolving conflict or dealing with its consequences. The delegates will also be discussing the issue of providing more help for the Syrian opposition. A US official said there are no signs of a change in Moscowâ€™s position and the radicalisation of some elements of the divided opposition have tempered the enthusiasm of some western nations to support the rebels militarily. Members of the Syrian opposition were on the fringes of the meeting ready to talk with those nations who wish to speak to them. US Secretary of State, John Kerry will attend the meeting of the so-called Friends of Syria in Istanbul on April 20. The United States agreed to provide non-lethal aid to Syrian rebels in February, and more than double its aid to the civilian population, but it has so far chosen not to provide arms.
