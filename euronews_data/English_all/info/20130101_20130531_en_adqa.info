# ORIG TITLE    Ousted president of Central African Republic flees to Cameroon . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Rebels wander through the presidential complex in the capital city of Bangui after taking control in the Central African Republic. Known as the Seleka rebel coalition, one of the leaders, Michel Djotodia, has named himself as president. The rebels say the power-sharing government put together in January and made up of Bozize loyalists, rebel leaders and the civilian opposition, will mainly stay the same. The prime minister will keep his job and there will be a small cabinet re-shuffle. Accused by Seleka of not honouring terms of January’s peace agreement, ousted president Francois Bozize has fled to Cameroon. It’s been reported that his family are in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The mineral-rich Central African Republic has been rocked by coups and rebellions since gaining independence from France in 1960. With more French troops sent to protect French nationals and diplomatic buildings, France now has 550 soldiers in the African country. Thirteen South African soldiers, meant to be helping to keep the peace, were killed when rebels seized Bangui on Sunday. The Central African Republic has been suspended from the African Union. The regional power bloc has condemned the actions of Seleka and imposed travel bans and asset freezes on rebel leaders.
