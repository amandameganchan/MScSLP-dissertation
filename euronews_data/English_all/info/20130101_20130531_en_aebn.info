# ORIG CONTENT  Israeli troops shot dead two Palestinian teenagers in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday night. Amer Nassar and Naji Belbasi 17 and 18-years-old respectively had been involved in the third day of unrest that followed the death of a prisoner in an Israeli jail. The Israeli army said troops fired on Palestinians who threw fire bombs after dark at a guard post in the northern West Bank. Tensions have risen sharply in the region since the death from cancer of 64-year-old Abu Hamdeya who was serving a life prison term for a planned attack on a Jerusalem caf√© in 2002. Palestinians accuse Israel of withholding care and failing to release him after diagnosing his illness was terminal. Israel said it followed normal procedures. The upsurge in violence comes just days before US Secretary of State John Kerry is due to visit Jerusalem and Ramallah in the hope of trying to make progress in reviving peace negotiations that broke down in 2010.
