# ORIG TITLE    UK to send astronaut to ISS in 2015 . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Major Timothy Peake is set to become the first British astronaut in space for more than 20 years. Peake, a former apache helicopter pilot with the British army, is expected to visit the International Space Station (ISS) in 2015. Before that, there is a lot to prepare for – as Peake explained to euronews: . “We do a lot of training in weightlessness, for example parabolic flights. We learn about EVA (Extra Vehicular Activity): how to do space walking. We learn about robotics,” Peake said. “I’ve trained as a Eurocom, which a communicator with the space station. We actually work with crew on board and help them in their daily jobs. We’re kept very busy while waiting for our mission assignment,” Peake continued. The UK Minister for Universities and Science David Willetts said: “We’ve got a very successful space industry that is growing at about eight per cent a year.” . “It’s an event like this, sending an astronaut up to the space station, that really brings home to people that we’re serious and it signals that Britain is a space-faring nation and proud of it,” Willetts added. British Prime Minister David Cameron said Peake’s selection, as one of six astronauts picked from 8,000 hopefuls, was a “landmark” moment for the UK.
