# ORIG TITLE    Fukushima: A legacy of unforeseen health problems . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The death rate of elderly people evacuated from old people’s facilities around the damaged Fukushima nuclear plant has tripled, according to research. The University of Tokyo tracked 328 senior evacuees and found 75 had died within one year, close to three times the annual average death rate. Researchers say the changes to routine and environment had adversely affected well-being. Japan is still dealing with the consequences of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Many related health problems are still coming to light. In Fukushima City, a school reported an increase in children with flatfeet, blamed on the restrictions on outdoor play due to the nuclear contamination. Two years after the disaster the area around the plant remains a no-go area. Google’s latest Street View mapping project deep inside the nuclear evacuation zone has unveiled a town devoid of human existence. Namie is now a ghost town following the evacuation of the 21,000 residents after the coastline was smashed by the tsunami and the nearby nuclear plant damaged.
