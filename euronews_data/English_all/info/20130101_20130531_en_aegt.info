# ORIG CONTENT  Real Madrid reached the Champions League semi-finals despite a 3-2 loss at Galatasaray on Tuesday after goals from Cristiano Ronaldo at the start and end of a pulsating match earned the Spaniards a 5-3 aggregate win. Madrid appeared comfortably on course for a shot at winning a 10th European Cup when Ronaldo scored in the seventh minute – his 10th goal in this season’s competition – with a close-range strike after Sami Khedira knocked in a low cross from the right. Emmanuel Eboue put Galatasaray level on the night in the 57th, rifling home from the edge of the area after a pull back from Wesley Sneijder who put them ahead in the 70th when he sent the ball between Raphael Varane’s legs before a neat finish. Two minutes later, Drogba extended Galatasaray’s lead to 3-1 with a delightful back heel inside the area from Nordin Amrabat’s cross before Ronaldo added his second in the third minute of injury time after being set up by Karim Benzema. Elsewhere on the night Borussia Dortmund struck twice in stoppage time to beat Malaga 3-2 and reach the last four in dramatic fashion. Malaga appeared to be heading into last four in their debut season in the Champions League but their dreams were dashed when stoppage time goals from Marco Reus and Felipe Santana sent the Germans through in a stunning encounter. The Spaniards, who drew 0-0 in the first leg, stunned the 66,000 crowd in Dortmund when Joaquin shook off his markers and drilled in a low shot for the lead in the 25th minute. Dortmund striker Robert Lewandowski drew the hosts level in the 40th minute and they squandered a string of chances in the second half with Marco Reus and Mario Goetze. Eliseu appeared to seal Dortmund’s fate when he put the Spaniards ahead in the 82nd minute, but Reus and Santana scored late in the game to spark wild celebrations among the home fans. REUTERS .
