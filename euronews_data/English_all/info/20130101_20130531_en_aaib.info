# ORIG CONTENT  More than 2,000 exhibitors went to Hong Kong this year for the annual Toys and Games Fair and, of course, as well as revealing traditional toys, many people were showing off their latest technology. So here’s a taste of what could be in the shops next Christmas! . There were realistic tanks for example, controlled by a smartphone. To play with them you download an app onto your phone, charge up your tanks and then let the battle commence. And one we’ve all been dreaming of… how to turn your smartphone into a gun albeit a toy one. Using the phone’s built-in camera the game allows players to shoot aliens in a augmented-reality environment. Virtual sport is also gaining market ground. Using a screen and some movement recognition technology, people in real life can join in with a game happening in virtual reality on a screen. But among the hi-tech wonders were also comfortingly lo-tech traditional toys like little battery operated puppies.
