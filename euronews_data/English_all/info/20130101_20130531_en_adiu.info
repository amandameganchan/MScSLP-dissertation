# ORIG TITLE    George Osborne dummy protest demands action on tax and hunger . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Campaigners for change to the world’s food system to reduce hunger and poverty have demonstrated outside the British parliament – all dressed as the country’s finance minister ahead of Wednesday’s Budget. Dozens of suited George Osborne lookalikes carried battered briefcases similar to the one the Chancellor of the Exchequer traditionally brings to the House of Commons on the day he unveils his plans. The campaigners’ slogan “Enough Food For Everyone IF…” calls for global action on issues like aid, farming and tax. “This year, the British government is chair of the G8, the eight most powerful nations in the world, and if together they create new global rules on tax and accountancy, that would benefit Britain as it would stop companies like Starbucks avoiding tax. But it would also benefit the poorest countries in the world, because they can use these new international rules to make sure that companies pay tax, so Britain is key to doing that this year with the G8,” said Max Lawson, Chairman of the “IF” campaign and Head of Policy at Oxfam. The movement, backed by 150 organisations, wants the Chancellor of the Exchequer to keep a promise to increase life-saving aid to poor countries. Reports suggest overseas aid will be protected from government plans for more spending cuts, thought to amount to almost three billion euros over the next two years.
