# ORIG TITLE    Chavez back in Venezuela – but questions abound . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Hugo Chavez is back in Venezuela, but uncertainty remains over his health and ability to govern the country. The 58-year-old has spent the last two months in Cuba being treated for the cancer first diagnosed in June 2011. Vice President Nicolas Maduro told reporters: “The whole team of commander Hugo Chavez is here. He is good, he is conscious, and is very happy and motivated to be here in his Venezuelan homeland, as he has said in his twitter message. We are all sharing this immense happiness and great motivation with the people”. Chavez has a strong emotional bond with Venezuela’s 29 million nationals. There is speculation, though, that he has come home to resign and arrange a smooth political transition after his 14-year tenure. It has been suggested that doctors say his cancer is terminal and they can do no more for him.
