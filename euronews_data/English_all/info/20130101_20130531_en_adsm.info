# ORIG TITLE    Italy: Five Star rejects Bersani in talks broadcast on Internet . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Pier Luigi Bersani, the leader of Italy’s centre-left, has failed to secure the support of the Five Star movement to form a government. The anti-establishment Five Star, which is calling for more transparency among politicians, broadcast its talks with Bersani live on the internet in an unprecedented move. Bersani has been trying to win support for a centre-left administration, but Five Star’s Senate Leader Vito Crimi said his movement was not prepared to join. “We are ready to give our support on some specific points. But, with regards to the Senate, our decision is to vote “no” in a confidence vote to a government created by Bersani and the Democratic Party,” Crimi said. Bersani’s talks with Silvio Berlusconi’s centre right have also so far come to nothing. Berlusconi’s PDL party has offered to form a grand coalition with the centre-left, but it wants a few things in return. One is a guarantee that Italy’s next president will be from the centre-right. Bersani has so far refused. Current President Georgio Napolitano’s mandate ends in May, further complicating the political impasse.
