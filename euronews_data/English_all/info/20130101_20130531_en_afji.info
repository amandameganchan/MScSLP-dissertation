# ORIG CONTENT  Visiting Mexico, US President Barack Obama was keen to stress the positives of the relationship between the two countries. Meetings with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto focused on economic ties. And on the thorny topic of immigration, Obama underlined the progress rather than the challenges: . “I think it’s important for everybody to remember that our shared border is more secure that it’s been in years. Illegal immigration attempts into the United States are near their lowest level in decades and legal immigration continues to make both of our countries stronger and more prosperous and more competitive,” Obama said. But there was an angry demonstration outside the American Embassy in Mexico City as Obama arrived in town. The protesters, many of whom were women and children deported from the US, called for Obama to take action on his pledges to overhaul immigration laws to provide potential citizenship for millions of undocumented residents in the US.
