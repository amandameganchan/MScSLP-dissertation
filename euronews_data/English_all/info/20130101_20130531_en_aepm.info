# ORIG CONTENT  North Korea has fired off new threats to South Korea vowing “sledge hammer blows” of retaliation. The anger was sparked by reported anti-North Korean protests in the South on Monday as their neighbours celebrated the birth of its founding leader. “Our retaliatory action will start without any notice from now,” reported the North’s state television. Despite the new ultimatum, a senior US military official in South Korea believed the North Korean leadership was looking for a way to cool down its rhetoric after weeks of warnings of war. South Korea reacted to the threat with a Foreign Ministry spokesman saying it was not worth a response and that it was waiting for the North to make a “wise decision”. Last week Seoul offered talks with their neighbours but the overture was rejected as a, “cunning ploy”. Analysts believe the diplomatic war of words have taken a softer edge. On the back of Tuesday’s ultimatum the North’s state media reported the North’s military saying that if “the puppet authorities truly want dialogue they should apologise for all anti-DPRK acts.” .
