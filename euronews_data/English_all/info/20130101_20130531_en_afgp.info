# ORIG TITLE    US Federal Reserve will stick with bond-buying policy . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The United States Federal Reserve has said it will continue to purchase 85 billion dollars (65 billion euros) in bonds every month, in order to keep interest rates low. The Fed has been using this policy, known as quantitative easing, to increase the money supply. The aim is to stimulate growth and support employment. Fed policymakers say unemployment remains too high to change this. They also criticised the government, saying its “fiscal policy is restraining economic growth”. The US economy rebounded in the first quarter, growing by 2.5 percent, but was still below expectations.
