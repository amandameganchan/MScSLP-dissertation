# ORIG CONTENT  A far-left Turkish terrorist group has claimed a suicide attack on the US embassy in Ankara. The Revolutionary People’s Liberation Army-Front posted details on a website with a picture of the bomber Ecevit Sanli. A Turkish security guard and the bomber died in the blast. Investigators say Sanli had travelled from Germany and was armed with high-explosives and grenades. Three people have been arrested. The group is virulently opposed to the United States and accused the Turkish prime minister of being a ‘puppet’ of Washington. It wants the US to remove Patriot missiles deployed in Turkey as a defence against the violence in neighbouring Syria.
