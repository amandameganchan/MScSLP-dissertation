# ORIG TITLE    Earth Hour sparks a worldwide switch-off . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Environment charity WWF launched the Paris end of their annual climate change awareness campaign by standing in front of a darkened Eiffel Tower. The lights had been switched off as part of Earth Hour. More than 152 countries around the world took part by doing the same â€“ turning the lights off on well known landmarks for one hour. The aim behind it was to support action to create a sustainable future for the planet. The event, which took place at 8.30pm local time on March 23 around the world, began in Samoa and connected with more than 7,000 cities in a mark of environmental solidarity.
