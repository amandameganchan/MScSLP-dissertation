# ORIG CONTENT  The conflict in Syria dominated talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as the two met at Putin’s residence at the Black Sea resort of Sochi. Moscow continues to send weapons to Damascus. Israel is reportedly worried these may soon include powerful Russian-made powerful S-300 ground-to-air missiles which have a range of up to 200 kilometres, though neither man mentioned these particular weapons. “We have a common understanding that if the armed conflict in Syria persists, it could have disastrous consequences for both Syria and the whole region. Only the quick ending of the armed conflict can prevent this negative scenario and this includes a political solution,” said Putin. Israel recently carried out air-strikes within Syria on convoys it said were delivering missiles to Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.
