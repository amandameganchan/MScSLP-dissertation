Presidential hopefuls have until next Monday to register their candidacy in the hope of filling Chavez’ shoes. Opposition leader Henrique Capriles has already said he will challenge election favourite and acting President Nicolas Maduro. “I’m not going to leave the way clear for you,” he warned his rival, “You’ll have to beat me with votes and I’m going to fight for every vote because I am fighting for this country.” . Two recent polls have predicted Maduro, a 50-year-old former bus driver and diehard Chavez fan, will win the election comfortably. He has vowed to carry on where Chavez left off and ratify his social programme.
