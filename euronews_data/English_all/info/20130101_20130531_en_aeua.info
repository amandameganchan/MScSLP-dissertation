# ORIG TITLE    Obama praises people of Boston as bombing suspect is caught . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Captured alive but wounded and described “as bleeding and in a serious condition”. The suspect in the Boston marathon bombing, Dzharkhov Tsarnaev, is being treated at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre in Boston. Tsarnaev, 19, had been hiding in a boat in the garden of a property in the Boston suburb of Watertown. Police were tipped off about his location after the homeowner came outside and noticed blood on his boat and saw a bleeding man inside. On hearing the suspect was taken into custody, Watertown residents celebrated. Speaking from the White House, US President Barack Obama said: “Tonight our nation is in debt to the people of Boston and the people of Massachusetts. After a vicious attack on their city, Bostonians responded with resolve and determination. They did their part as citizens and partners in this investigation. Boston police and state police, and local police across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts responded with professionalism and bravery over five long days,” added Obama. The suspect’s brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, was killed during a shootout with police the previous night. The FBI have revealed they interviewed him two years ago, but found nothing incriminating . A further three people – two men and one woman – are in custody and being questioned in connection with Monday’s marathon bombing. Three people died and around 170 were wounded when two devices exploded near the marathon’s finish line. A police officer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was shot and killed after encountering the two suspects on Thursday night.
