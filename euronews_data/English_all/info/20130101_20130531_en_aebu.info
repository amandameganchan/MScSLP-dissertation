# ORIG CONTENT  US President Barack Obama is trying re-ignite the Congress debate on gun-control legislation, pushing for background checks on all gun buyers. He went to Colorado, a state which has recently introduced such legislation. Obama said background checks are an example of how better control can be implemented without infringing on the US Constitutional right to bear arms. Speaking at Denver Police Academy, Obama said: “I believe there doesn’t have to be a conflict in reconciling these realities. There doesn’t have to be a conflict between protecting our citizens and protecting our Second Amendment rights.” . US opinion polls show strong support for background checks and other measures – but gun rights advocates, led by the National Rifle Association (NRA), have lobbied fiercely against any new legislation. So, although Obama may be in favour of rolling out Colorado’s “practical measures”, as he called them, nationwide – getting new legislation through Congress and the Senate will not be simple.
