# ORIG TITLE    Paris Fashion A-listers and more . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Manish Arora has shown his new collection at Paris Fashion Week. It was inspired by a trip to Nevada: “The first thing when I came back that I remembered was the amazing blue sky with white clouds and the empty desert. And that’s how I started the collection. And it went on into the evening and there were clouds with neon signs and then it went on to only the neon lights. It was really the eight days that I spent at Burning Man put into this collection.” . The Burning Man is a subculture festival held every August in the Black Rock Nevada Desert. Guillaume Henry showed his pret-a-porter collection for the “Carven” label: “We were inspired by movies from the 80’s. We had in mind a woman who look like a Beatrice Dalle, you know the French actress, she’s very sexy but she’s kind of vulnerable at the same time. You want to, you know, almost take her in your arms but at the same time she’s kind of aggressive. I like this idea of mixing soft proportions with kind of strong, violent details like tulle with latex, very sugary colors, but with rubber shoes. She’s not too girly and she’s not too fatale, she’s in the middle.” . The stars came out for the Lanvin autumn/winter pret-a-porter show at the Beaux Art Academy in Paris. Catherine Deneuve was among the A-list crowd as was Jack Lang, Laura Smet and Pace Wu.
