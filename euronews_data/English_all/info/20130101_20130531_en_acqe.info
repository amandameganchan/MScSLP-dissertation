# ORIG TITLE    More deaths in Bangladesh war crimes violence . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Violent clashes in Bangladesh over the past three days have left at least 60 people dead. The protests have been triggered by a death sentence issued against an Islamist party leader on charges of rape and torture dating back to the 1971 war of independence. Jamaat-e-Islami party supporters in the city of Chittagong believe the sentence is politically motivated. Three of their members have already been convicted by a special tribunal set up by the government to deal with those accused of collaborating with Pakistani forces during the war. In all, nine Jamaat leaders and two members of the closely allied opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party are on trial.
