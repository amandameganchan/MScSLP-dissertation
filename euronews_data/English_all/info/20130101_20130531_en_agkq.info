# ORIG TITLE    Nifontov and Polling win judo gold in Russia . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Russian Ivan Nifontov won gold in the men’s under 81 kilo class on the second and final day of The World Judo Masters in Tyuman Russia on Sunday. The world number 16 took the title after beating Paris Grand Slam bronze medallist Keita Nagashima of Japan. The 2009 World and European champion thrilled the home crowd when he finally broke through with a juji-gatame arm lock. Nagashima tried to escape the clutches of his rival but in the end could go no further and tapped out leaving Nifontov to celebrate gold. Kim Polling of the Netherlands once again delivered on the big stage as she stunned world number one Kelita Zupancic of Canada to claim the women’s under 70 kilo division. Polling – who won gold at the European Championships in Budapest, Hungary last month – needed two minutes of the final bout to get the upper hand on her opponent. The Dutch judoka threw Zupancic to win by ippon to seal her first of what will surely be many World Judo Masters titles.
