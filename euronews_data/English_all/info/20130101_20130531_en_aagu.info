# ORIG TITLE    How wallpaper could save earthquake victims . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Several hundred people were killed in the 2011 earthquake in Van in Turkey and tens of thousands were left homeless after their houses were destroyed. As homes, offices, hospitals and schools were shaken, their walls started falling as the majority were built of brick. While brick buildings are relatively inexpensive and solid, they are vulnerable during earthquakes. This episode of Hi-Tech looks at a novel way of stabilising brick walls â€“ anti-seismic wallpaper.
