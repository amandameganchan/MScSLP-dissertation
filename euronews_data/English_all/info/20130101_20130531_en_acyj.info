# ORIG TITLE    Cardinals set date for conclave with not clear winner in mind . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Roman Catholic cardinals leave the Synod hall at the Vatican after finally setting a date to begin the conclave to elect the next pope. Tuesday March the 12 is to be the all important day. Until then discussions will continue on the state of the 1.2 billion-member church and to decide on the profile of the man they want to lead them. So far no individual as been tipped as a clear favourite. For some including the Arch Bishop of Caracas it could be a chance to have a South American Pope: . “ There are a large number of Latin American cardinals with lots of experience and humanity so that everything is possible,” said Cardinal Jorge Urosa Savino. On Tuesday afternoon the 115 cardinals eligible to vote will enter the Sistine chapel to take part in the election ballot until one man receives a two-thirds majority. However long it takes, eventually the winner will be revealed to the thousands of pilgrims waiting outside in St Peter’s square.
