# ORIG CONTENT  The political stalemate continues in Italy following inconclusive parliamentary elections. Democratic Party leader Pier Luigi Bersani, has ruled out any grand coalition with Silvio Berlusconi’s centre-right group. Bersani has made tentative moves towards Beppe Grillo’s Five Star Movement, which took the election by storm becoming the single largest party in Italy. Thus far Grillo has ruled out getting into bed with any of Italy’s traditional parties, but said his group would consider proposals “law by law, reform by reform”. Still a reformist leftist coalition could prove tempting to the movement’s grassroots, many of whom are entering politics for the first time. Bersani’s centre-left coalition won a majority in the lower house, but failed to gain the numbers in the Senate. To govern Italy a majority in both houses is a requirement. Bersani said he is to deliver a plan for Italy’s political future to President Giorgio Napolitano, who will have the task of forming a new government.
