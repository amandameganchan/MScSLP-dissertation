# ORIG TITLE    Palestinians mark ‘Nakba’ anniversary . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Hundreds of people have joined a march in the West Bank city of Ramallah to mark this year’s “Nakba” anniversary. “Nakba” means “Catastrophe” and is the name Palestinians use to refer to the creation of the State of Israel in 1948. Earlier, clashes erupted after Palestinian protesters gathered close to Bethlehem in the West Bank. Tear gas was fired, as some of the crowd scuffled with Israeli police. Troops prevented some demonstrators from reaching the Husan checkpoint, from where they said they wanted to reach their ancestral homes in modern-day Israel. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled their homes or were displaced during the war that established the Jewish state. For more than six decades, Palestinians have maintained that those who were uprooted all have the right to reclaim former properties. Israel rejects the demand. The fate of Palestinian refugees has loomed large in the failure of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
