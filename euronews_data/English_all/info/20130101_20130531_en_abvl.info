# ORIG TITLE    When lightning struck a stricken Holy See . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Just a few hours after Benedict XVI surprised the world and shook Christiandom when he announced his intention to quit the papacy, St Peter’s Basilica in the Vatican was struck by several bolts of lightning during a nightly thunderstorm. Right after the Pope’s historical announcement, the Vatican’s former second in command, Angelo Sodano, had called it “a bolt of lightning in a clear blue sky.” For some, this lightning may be the signs the skies above agree with him.
