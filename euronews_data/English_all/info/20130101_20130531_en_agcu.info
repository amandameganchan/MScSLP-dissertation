# ORIG TITLE    Syria: fierce battle for strategic town of Qusair . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Around 30 Hezbollah fighters and 20 Syrian soldiers have been killed in fierce fighting in Qusair since Sunday May 19 – according to activists opposed to President Bashar al Assad. The town, which is located near the Lebanese border, had been a stronghold of opposition forces until the Syrian regime launched an offensive to recapture the strategically important town. The Syrian state news agency announced on May 20 that the army had taken control of most of Qusair and killed a hundred of what it called ‘terrorists’. Activists, however, said the town had not been captured. Qusair is seen as a conduit for supplies and fighters from Lebanon, which is just 10 kilometres away. For the Syrian regime, controlling it would help link the capital Damascus with its strongholds on the Mediterranean coast.
