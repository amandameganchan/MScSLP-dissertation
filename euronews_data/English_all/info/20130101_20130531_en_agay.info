# ORIG TITLE    At least 80 die in Iraqi bombings . 
# ORIG CONTENT  At least 80 people have been killed in Iraq on a violent Friday of bombings in three major cities. The worst was a double attack in Bakuba, the first explosion ripping through a crowd of civilians, and the second coming shortly after as people came running to help. At least 43 of the dead were from this one incident in front of a Sunni mosque, just after Friday prayers. Baghdad suffered eight dead as the funeral of a prominent Sunni cleric killed the day before was targeted. That came on the heels of the overnight deaths of another 22 people in and around the capital. Four people were also killed in Falluja when a bomb exploded outside a cafe. No-one has claimed responsibility for any of the latest attacks.
