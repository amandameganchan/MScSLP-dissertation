# ORIG TITLE    Goal-line technology to make World Cup debut . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Following rigorous testing and a successful trial period goal-line technology will be used at the 2014 World Cup after it was given the green light by world football’s governing body FIFA. Goal-line technology had already been implemented at the Club World Cup in December – although there were no incidents where it was called upon. But FIFA confirmed it will be used at next month’s Confederations Cup in Brazil and next years World Cup where all 12 venues will be installed with the technology. Two systems – Hawkeye and Goalref, have already been licensed by the governing body while two other companies from Germany are also in the hunt to provide their systems for the tournaments with the winner expected to be announced in early April. After years of rejection by FIFA goal-line technology was last year approved by football’s rule makers – the International Football Association Board.
