# ORIG TITLE    Bayern Munich win fifth European Cup beating Dortmund 2-1 . 
# ORIG CONTENT  So Bayern Munich get another star to sew onto their jerseys and Dortmund must wait a little longer to silence the doubters who say their Champion’s League win in 1997 was just a fluke. On the night there was little difference between the sides; Dortmund started the quickest, and impressed during a first half when they did everything but score. They had chances, but none were taken. Bayern came back in the second, dominated possession, but equally could not make the most of their chances. Finally with just half-an-hour to go Mario Manduzic scored to end the deadlock. Bayern’s fans in Wembley and back home in Munich went mental. After losing two Champion’s League finals in three years surely they would not be denied again? . But only eight minutes later Guendogan had levelled for Dortmund with a penalty. Dante, the guilty party, was already on a yellow card, but the referee did nothing. Lucky Bayern. It was game on again and the tackles got more crunching, and tempers rose. Dortmund’s fans did not care. They were back in it. Finally in the 89th minute Arjen Robben got a layoff from Ribery in the box, and made no mistake, going on an adrenaline-fuelled bug-eyed run of celebration. Bayern will have a new manager next year, Juppe Henkes is on his way after becoming only the fourth coach to win the European Cup with two clubs. Pep Guardiola replaces him. He may well be able to take them even further. But for now Bayern are exactly where they want to be, Kings of Europe.
