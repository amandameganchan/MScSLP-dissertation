# ORIG CONTENT  Millions of travellers on the Moscow metro are having to share their space with some unusually silent passengers. The so-called Watercolour Train has been running on the Russian underground since 2007 and this latest edition features some of cities most important art works. “I use this line often and it’s nice to see these pictures. I hope it makes art more accessible to young people,” said one commuter. The train has been specially adapted so that pictures can be hung, protected by special glass frames. And despite initial concerns over their safety, there have been no serious incidents since the watercolour train has been on the tracks.
