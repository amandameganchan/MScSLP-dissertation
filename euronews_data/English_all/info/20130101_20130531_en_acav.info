# ORIG TITLE    Police clash with anti-Mursi protestors in Cairo rally . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Thousands of Islamists rallied in Cairo on Friday night in what is becoming a regular show of support for President Mohammed Mursi. But it did not take long before violence erupted. Repeating the pattern of recent weeks, Mursi’s opponents gathered and clashed with security forces as night fell. The pro-Mursi rally was called by a hardline Salafi Islamist group, Al-Gama’a al-Islamiya, in what it described as a protest under the banner “Together Against Violence”. The Muslim Brotherhood and its Freedom and Justice Party said it backed Friday’s rally in a symbolic way but did not mobilise supporters for the event, meaning the numbers were smaller than at previous Islamist protests.
