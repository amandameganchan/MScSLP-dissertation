# ORIG TITLE    Maze sets new World Cup record . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Tina Maze rewrote the alpine skiing history books on Saturday when she won the women’s downhill in Garmisch Partenkirschen to set a new World Cup points record of 2,024. The Slovenian has dominated all season and her points tally not only made her the first women to break the 2000 barrier but she has also beated the tally of Austrian great Hermann Maier’ who totalled 2,000 points when he won the men’s overall World Cup in 2000. Maze also became only the second woman in modern skiing to win in all five disciplines in the same season after Croatia’s Janica Kostelic in 2006. It was the ninth World Cup victory of the campaign for the 29-year-old overall and giant slalom world cup champion who is also on track to become the first skier to win all the disicpline titles in a single season. American Laurenne Ross was second to underline once again the US team’s excellent form in the speed events this season. Ross was 0.39 seconds off Maze’s pace for the runners up spot – the sixth skier from the women’s US team to make the podium in a speed event in this World Cup campaign. It was Ross’s highest placed world cup finish in three years on the circuit for the 24-year-old. Maria Hoefl-Riesch gave the home crowd something to cheer about by rounding out the top three. In her home resort the German – who is second in the overall standings a whopping 1054 points behind Maze – was five tenths of a second off her rival’s time.
