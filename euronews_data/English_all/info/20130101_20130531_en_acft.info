# ORIG TITLE    World gets first look at Google Glass . 
# ORIG CONTENT  “Ok Glass, record the video…” . Google has unveiled the first demo video of its much-awaited Google Glass, what it calls the future of “wearable technology”, seen as the major growth area for hardware makers in 2013 and beyond. The video showed how Glass can be used to take pictures and record video, as well as share content directly via email or social networks. Voice commands such as “OK, Glass, take a picture” are used to control the device. Other features appeared to include Skype-like video chats, and other related information such as weather reports and map directions. All of this information appears in a small, translucent square in the top right of the wearer’s field of vision. The display is considerably less intrusive than previously published concept videos. “It is emerging technology. It requires huge advances in speech recognition and image recognition, in battery technology and communications technology. I like seeing these big visions but don’t see it as being there yet,” says principal analyst at reDesign Mobile Rocky Agrawal. Actually, a lucky few have already got their hands on the product to see what it can do, and it’s been sold to developers and selected celebrities. But it’s not so easy: if you want to buy one, you have to apply, explaining why you want it and how you will use it. Then, the company chooses who “deserves” to buy these glasses first at 1000 euros a pop. It goes to the mass market by the end of this year, but the buzz is growing, building an intense “hype aura” to the product. Maybe it is also to iron out the problems it could raise in terms of privacy or even security or “mass control”, (it is like wearing a sort of Facebook on your nose). “So it’ll open up some new, interesting situations in society I think. People will see other people wearing those glasses and know full well that they could be getting their pictures taken or video taken of them right then. So it has a creepy factor to it too,” says technology writer Mike Liedtke. Others say that Project Glass will not interfere with people’s daily life too much, constantly streaming information to them and distracting from the real world. These glasses could free people from technology, (for example, if you want to take a photo you will not need to reach into your pocket and take out the phone).
