# ORIG CONTENT  The Turkish Foreign Minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, has said that Turkey reserves the right to take “every kind of measure” after the car bomb attacks that killed more than 40 people in the town of Reyhanli near the border with Syria on Saturday. Ankara suspects Syrian involvement and fears that the two year civil war was dragging in neighbouring states despite renewed diplomatic moves. Turkey has said that they see no need in holding an emergency meeting of the NATO military alliance following the deadly bomb attacks. The country supports the uprising against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. Syria’s war is already helping to ignite sectarian, religious and nationalist tensions across the Middle East.
