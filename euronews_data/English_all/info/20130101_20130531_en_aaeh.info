# ORIG CONTENT  The British Oscar-winning actress Dame Helen Mirren has been honoured with a star on Hollywood’s Walk of Fame. She won the award for best actress in 2007 after playing Queen Elizabeth in the film “The Queen”. Her star sits next to that of fellow Oscar winner Colin Firth, who played the Queen’s father George VI in “The King’s Speech.” . “Everyone was very shocked to discover that the Duke of Edinburgh and the Queen slept in separate bedrooms. Well I’m very pleased and proud and I think it’s very good for the British monarchy that here on Hollywood Boulevard, the King and the Queen are going to actually sleep together, for the rest of history. I couldn’t be prouder and more happy that I’m actually going to finally lie next to Colin Firth,” she said at a ceremony in Hollywood, where she posed for photographs alongside her new star. The Walk of Fame serves as a lifetime achievement award for those in the entertainment industry. Dame Helen Mirren, who is 67, is due to act the part of the Queen again in a stage play in London. “The Audience” is centred on the monarch’s weekly meetings with prime ministers.
