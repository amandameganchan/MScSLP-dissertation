# ORIG TITLE    Stars are again out in force in Cannes . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Robert Redford is promoting his film ‘All is lost’. Playing a solo yachtsman adrift at sea, it’s his first major role in years. His character is not named and he has little dialogue. ‘Lost at Sea’ isn’t in the running for the top prize, the Palme d’Or, but the latest offering from Roman Polanski is. La Venus a la Fourrure (Venus in Furs) . is one of the 20 films up for the top slot. Emmanuelle Seigner plays an actress trying to convince a director to give her a role. ‘Only God Forgives’, by Danish director Widding Nicholas Refn, was booed after screening because of its ultra-violence. Ryan Gosling, who plays the male lead, has not made the trip to Cannes. But there’s a little more warmth with “GrisGris” by Mahamat-Saleh Haroun. It’s the only African film in the competition, but it seems to have little chance of winning.
