# ORIG TITLE    MipTV celebrates half a century . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Cannes is bracing itself for the 50th anniversary of MipTV – the annual showcase for TV and online content across all platforms, where productions are bought and sold, and (hopefully) new creative partnerships are forged. Laurine Garaude, director of the Television Division at Reed Midem – organisers of the spectacle – notes that the event is as relevant as ever: “Consumers are watching content, watching TV shows and interacting with shows on every screen now. From the big home entertainment, to PCs, and smartphones and tablets. They are consuming different types of TV more and more as a result.” . With a speaking programme boasting some of the world’s most renowned producers, the expected 11,000 international visitors will also be privy to special screening premieres. As Garaude explains, MipTV is always looking to leave participants with a special experience: . “Something that entirely new in this MipTv is an event called “The original online content screenings”, held in partnership with YouTube. We’ll be presenting new European channels on YouTube, with a number of different types of coming channels: make-up, cuisine, cooking…” . Amongst this year’s highlights, visitors can also look forward to a first-hand glimpse of the eagerly anticipated Da Vinci’s Demons series, scripted by The Dark Knight trilogy writer David S. Goyer. This historical fantasy, following the ‘untold’ story of the world’s greatest genius during his turbulent youth in Renaissance Florence, is set for European release in late April.
