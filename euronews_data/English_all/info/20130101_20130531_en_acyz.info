The violence erupted in response to a court ruling on last years football stadium riot in which more than 70 people were killed. Earlier fans of the local Cairo team had set fire to the headquarters of the Egyptian Football Association. Most of those who died last year had been fellow supporters watching their side play away at Port Said. Saturday’s court ruling confirmed 21 death sentences and 28 acquittals. Cairo fans want more people charged. In Port Said about 2,000 residents who want their local fans spared execution blockaded ferries crossing the Suez canal.
