# ORIG CONTENT  Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has returned home from cancer surgery in Cuba. His vice president Nicolas Maduro confirmed that Chavez flew in from Havana in the early hours of the morning and is now at a military hospital in Caracas. Chavez went to Cuba in December for further treatment after first being diagnosed with cancer in mid-2011. This time, it is reported that he had tumours removed from his pelvic region. In a Twitter message on Monday, Chavez thanked the Venezuelan people and confirmed that he will continue his treatment at home. Following intense speculation, on Friday the first photos in months were released of Chavez since the operation.
