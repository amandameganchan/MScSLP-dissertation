# ORIG TITLE    Anti-Thatcherites turn their back on Iron Lady’s coffin . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The Thatcher coffin was generally greeted with applause and even cheers along the route, but not everyone was there to laud her achievements. The divisions that Margaret Thatcher was blamed for during her time as prime minister were still evident 23 years after she left power. One protester on the funeral route in London said: “So many people internationally and domestically could have done with the help of a powerful lady like that, but instead she turned her back on us, and she looked after the rich and the powerful. So we’re here to turn our backs on her now that we have that chance.” . Another said: “The fact that this funeral is taking place, paid for by us, gives us the right to express an alternative opinion – that not everyone thinks that this should have happened.” . Thatcher’s supporters paint her as a champion of freedom, but opponents point out that her policies led to the destruction of communities and livelihoods, and promoted an era where individual greed became king.
