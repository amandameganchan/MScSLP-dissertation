# ORIG TITLE    PKK leader to call for peace with Turkish government . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Abdullah Ocalan, the jailed leader of armed Kurdish rebel group the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), is to make a “historic call” for peace with the Turkish government. Ocalan is expected to reveal his proposals on Thursday, March 21, which could include a ceasefire declaration and a timetable for the stand down of PKK fighters. Some, like Sukru Mersin, a Kurdish resident of Isanbul, feel this is long overdue: . “We’re like brothers,” he said. “‘This one is a Kurd, that one is a Turk,’ there is no such thing. I’ve been living in Istanbul for years and nobody has ever said to me: ‘you’re a Kurd.’ We don’t have that problem. But because of this terrorism issue, our villages are now empty, and if there’s peace, we’ll all be happy.” . Turkish officials have recently been holding talks with Ocalan who is serving a life sentence, in an island prison off Istanbul, for insurgency. Asli Aydintasbas a Columnist for Turkish newspaper, Milliyet, said both parties are finally seeing reason after almost 30 years of bloody conflict: . “One (reason) . is the realisation that you can’t win. It doesn’t mean you’ve lost, but you can’t win – and this goes for both sides.” . The conflict between the autonomy-seeking Kurds and the Turkish authorities has cost tens of thousands of lives since it first began in 1984. The PKK is considered a terrorist organisation by NATO, the EU and the United States.
