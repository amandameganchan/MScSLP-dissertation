# ORIG TITLE    Mexican journalists call for justice for one of their own . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Hundreds of protesters in the Mexican state of Veracruz have marked the anniversary of the death of a journalist they claim was murdered because of her work. Regina Martinez often wrote about drug trafficking and alleged links with the Mexican authorities . Local police claim she was just the victim of a robbery but her supporters dispute this along with the deaths of several other journalists. Daniela Pastrana, who works for an organisation representing journalists said that no one was convinced by the police investigation into Martinez’s death. Attacks on journalists in Veracruz have become all too common in the state which is plagued by clashes among powerful drug cartels. The issue has become so serious Mexico’s congress has just passed a bill making a federal investigation mandatory into assaults on reporters.
