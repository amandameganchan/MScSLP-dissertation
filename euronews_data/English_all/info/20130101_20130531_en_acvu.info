# ORIG TITLE    Berlusconi handed one year jail sentence in wiretapping scandal . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has been sentenced to one year in jail over illegal wiretapping. The prosecution claimed Berlusconi arranged for a police wiretap of a political rival to be leaked to his family newspaper. The taped conversation was between former centre-left leader Piero Fassinio and the head of insurance giant Unipol. The pair discussed the attempted takeover of Banca Nazionale del Lavoro by Unipol in 2005. The newspaper II Giornale published the transcripts on the eve of the 2006 election in order to discredit Fassino. The court awarded Fassino 80,000 euros. Berlusconi’s lawyer attacked the verdict saying the charges “were weak, contradictory and even completely lacking.” Berlusconi has the right of appeal. The AC Milan owner is in the middle of a series of trials with tax fraud cases looming and charges of paying for sex with an underage prostitute. Late on Wednesday another court cleared the broadcast rights arm of his Mediaset group of buying film and television rights at inflated prices to evade 10 million euros in taxes.
