# ORIG CONTENT  Medical charity Doctors without Borders is warning that thousands of Malian refugees in a UN-run camp in neighbouring Mauritania are facing appalling conditions. Healthy people are falling sick upon arrival, they have to build their own shelters, and there is currently only one toilet for every 3,000 people. The Mbera camp holds 70,000 refugees in one of Mauritania’s remotest corners. The charity said conditions have worsened since France’s military intervention in January. “Everyone who arrives is in need of aid. They need help. There needs to be a framework so that this can be done in a more systematic fashion, and much faster,” said Doctors without Borders co-ordinator Fabien Mukebela Kabongo. The charity said a total of 100,000 people from northern Mali are currently displaced, either within Mali or in neighbouring states. It is calling on aid agencies working within the camp under UNHCR co-ordination to redouble their efforts to provide shelter, clean water, food and latrines.
