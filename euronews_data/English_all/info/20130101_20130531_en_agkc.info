# ORIG TITLE    Cannes: Venus and Vampires vie for the Palme d’Or . 
# ORIG CONTENT  It’s a wrap in Cannes as the last day of competition screenings rolls out with movie heavy weights. French-Polish director Roman Polanski has set his sight on the top prize with ‘Venus in Fur’. He last won the prize in 2002 for the semi-autobiographical ‘The Pianist’ about the Warsaw ghetto. This year he explores the relationship between director and actor, with his wife Emmanuelle Seigner taking the lead. Euronews correspondent Frédéric Ponsard reports direct from the red carpet: . ‘La Vie d’Adele’, or ‘Blue is the Warmest Colour’ has critics falling over themselves to praise its depiction of an intimate love story between two women. It is being called the revelation of the Festival, putting it in good stead to sweep the board for its director and two leading ladies. American director Jim Jarmusch has offered up a tale of retro-cool vampire love, with ‘Only Lovers Left Alive’. Starring indie favourite Tilda Swinton, Jarmusch joked that he made a film starring supernatural bloodsuckers after hearing you could make a lot of money with them.
