# ORIG CONTENT  British cycling great Sir Chris Hoy on Thursday announced his retirement from the sport. Speaking at a news conference in Edinburgh the 37-year-old Scott admitted that he had used “every last ounce of energy and effort” he had at last summer’s Olympics in London. He had been expected to compete at next year’s Commonwealth Games in Glasgow but decided to call it a day instead and leave his place for someone else. He said: “I made it to London and I was successful in London but I think maybe people don’t realise how much that took out of me, and so to try to go on for another year is I think going to be too much and one year too far for me. And I didn’t want to turn up just to wave to the crowd and get the tracksuit, I wanted to be there to try to win a medal for Scotland and because I don’t think that I can do that I’d rather just step aside and let someone else take my place. “ . At the Olympics in London Hoy became Britain’s most successful Olympian with a career six gold medals – the first of which came in Athens 2004. He won three more in Beijing and then two more in London. On top of the six Olympic gold medals Hoy – the 2008 BBC Sports Personality of the Year – also claimed 11 World titles.
