# ORIG TITLE    Coup attempt foiled in Chad . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Security forces in Chad have announced they have foiled an attempted coup against the government which they claim had been in preparation for several months. President Idriss Deby and government members were described as safe and that several arrests had been made. A police source said among those detained had been civilians, members of the military and opposition MP Saleh Makki. The impoverished former French colony has a long history of coups and rebellions, and Deby himself seized power in 1990. Since then he has won four elections and cast himself as a key ally of the West against al-Qaeda-linked Islamist fighters.
