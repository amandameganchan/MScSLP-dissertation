# ORIG TITLE    Defending champions Olympiacos reach Euroleague final . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Olympiacos remain on track to become the first back-to-back winners of the Euroleague in seven years after beating CSKA Moscow to reach the final again. CSKA’s Sonny Weems scored the first points of the semi but the rematch of last season’s showpiece game quickly turned in favour of the defending champions from Greece who went on to completely dominate their Russian opponents. It was a one way street after the first quarter. In fact, such was their dominance in the semi-final at the O2 Arena in London Olympiacos enjoyed a double-digit lead throughout the entire second half. New jersey native Kyle Hines, 26, paced the winners with 13 points – the centre also had 10 rebounds. Power forward Pero Antic also added 13 points while newly crowned MVP Vassilis Spanoulis tallied 8 points, 5 rebounds and 4 assists to reach his third final in as many Final Four appearances. Olympiacos booked their ticket for Sunday’s final again at the O2 Arena with a commanding 69-52 victory.
