# ORIG TITLE    Varied title celebrations for Barca and PSG . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Manchester United were not the only ones across Europe to celebrate their title winning exploits on Monday. Barcelona paraded their La Liga trophy through the streets of the Catalan capital. The clubâ€™s 22nd title was a rather straight forward affair this season despite new coach Tito Vilanova missing chunks of the season to battle cancer. Barca became only the second side to lead a 20-team league from beginning to end after Real completed the same feat in 1987-88 season. It was their fourth La Liga crown in five campaigns. It was an altogether different kind of celebration in the French capital where Paris Saint Germain and their fans attempted to celebrate their first league title since 1994. The celebrations were cut short after violence reared its ugly head marring what was supposed to have been the crowning glory for the club. Disturbances broke out minutes after the players were ushered off the stage for security reasons. Running battles between fans and police then erupted in the streets surrounding the area around the Eiffel Tower where the ceremony was to take place. Police were forced to use tear gas to disperse the crowd. Thirty people have been reportedly injured, three of which were police officers.
