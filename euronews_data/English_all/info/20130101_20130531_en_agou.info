# ORIG CONTENT  As a potential trade war hots up with China over the price of imported solar panels, environmental campaigners have warned that Europe risks falling behind on renewable energy. Jason Anderson, head of EU and climate policy at the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) conservation organisation, said the 27 member bloc should be doing more. “We start with energy savings, grow with renewable. In doing that we’ll grow the amount of jobs that we already have. One million jobs in renewable sectors, in Europe; that can go up to 2.5 million in the next 10 years. That will contribute to our competitiveness,” Anderson told euronews. The World Bank says since 1990 China has seen the greatest expansion of renewables, which now account for 18 percent of the global energy mix. The energy sector believes the focus should also be on reducing reliance on fossil fuels such as coal and oil. Nearly 200 countries are trying to broker a new UN pact by 2015 to slow global warming.
