# ORIG CONTENT  In London, a mass grave has been discovered which might hold the remains of some 50,000 people killed by the “Black Death” plague in the 12th century. The find was made in Farringdon by researchers working on the 20 billion euros Crossrail project. Historical records described the area as a “no man’s land” which once housed a hastily established cemetery for victims of the bubonic plague which killed about a third of England’s population following its outbreak in 1348.
