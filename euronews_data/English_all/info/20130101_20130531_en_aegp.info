# ORIG TITLE    Kinky Boots on Broadway . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A new show has opened on Broadway in New York. Kinky Boots was originally a 2005 film set in the UK but has now morphed into a musical thanks to an original score from Cyndi Lauper. The first night, at the Hirschfeld Theatre, attracted a galaxy of famous faces, all keen to say nice things about their famous friend. Cyndi Lauper herself said that she was honoured to be part of the show. Liza Minnelli said: “I think she can do anything. She’s so talented on top of being such a good friend and a nice person.” . Harvey Fierstein, who wrote the script for the show, said: “A New York opening night, you know it’s a Broadway opening. It’s the stuff as a kid you dream about. There’s your name on the marquee!” . Glenn Close said: “She’s an incredibly creative person, and I think yes, it is bold of her. I think it’s very courageous and fabulous. I think Broadway needs all the new creative juices and inspirations it can take.” . The musical tells the story of Charlie Price who saves his staid northern shoe factory by breaking into a niche market of outrageous boots for transvestite men. For more information see .
