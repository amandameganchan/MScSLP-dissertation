# ORIG TITLE    Opposition anger over Egypt’s state of emergency . 
# ORIG CONTENT  As protesters continue to confront police on the streets of Cairo, Egypt’s main opposition coalition criticised the President declaring a state of emergency in three cities along the Suez Canal. Azazi Ali Azazi, leader of the Popular Egyptian Current party in National Salvation Front coalition (FSN) described President Mohammed Morsi’s words as “disturbing” and full of “threats and warnings for the Egyptian people.” . In a televised speech on Sunday, Morsi said he had read the constitution before taking the decision to declare a state of emergency for 30 days in the three Suez Canal provinces of Port Said, Suez and Ismailia. All three will also have nightly curfews starting on Monday from 21:00 to 06:00 local time, according to the President. Morsi added he would not hesitate in taking even more action to stem the violence which claimed more than 50 lives over the weekend – with Port Said seeing the most amount of deaths. However, some feel their regions are being unfairly targeted, like one man in Suez who was scathing in his opinion: “The state of emergency is a failure to make a decision for 30 days. Why is that? Will Morsi solve the world’s issues in this time? . “Why didn’t he impose a curfew in Cairo or Alexandria? Was he scared of them? Why Suez? What does he want from us and what is his message? What he’s doing is really shameful,” he added. The violence was sparked by death sentences for 21 people involved in a riot that became Egypt’s worst-ever football disaster. Seventy-four people were killed after a game at Port Said stadium between local side al-Masry and Cairo’s al-Ahly last February. Al-Masry fans invaded the pitch, throwing stones and fireworks. Spectators were trampled to death as panicked crowds tried to flee the stadium.
