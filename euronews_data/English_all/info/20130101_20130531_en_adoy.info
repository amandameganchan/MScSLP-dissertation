# ORIG TITLE    Little sympathy among Moscovites over Berezovsky’s death . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Evil, clever and cunning and the master of chaos – just some of the adjectives being widely used in the Russian media to describe Boris Berezovsky. But there seems to be little sympathy among some Moscovites over his demise. “Do you think he was honest in everything he did, in the way he amassed all his money? I don’t think he was very honest.” . When questioned over if he has done any good for Russia another man said: “No, but neither has Abramovich or any kind of people like that….One can’t even call them people,” he added. “They haven’t done anything for Russia.” . But not everyone takes such a frosty view. One woman said she believed he was a good man, adding she feels very deeply for him. “Inside our souls we just wish he rests in peace.” .
