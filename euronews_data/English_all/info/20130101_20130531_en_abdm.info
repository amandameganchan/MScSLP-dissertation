# ORIG TITLE    Eleven dead in Portuguese bus tragedy . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A bus has crashed in Portugal killing 11 people on board and injuring 33 more. It happened in the east of the country near the city of Castelo Branco. A spokesman for the rescue services said all of the dead were Portuguese. It is believed the bus was heading for Santa Maria da Feira 35 kilometres from Oporto when it left the road in wet conditions and plunged down a ravine. Traffic on the carriageway came to a standstill as more than 250 firefighters spearheaded the rescue operation backed up by at least one air ambulance helicopter. The sheer number of casualties stretched medical resources and the injured had to be taken to hospitals in Castelo Branco nearby and Coimbra 150 kilometres away.
