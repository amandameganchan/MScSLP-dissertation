# ORIG CONTENT  American doctor Kermit Gosnell could face the death penalty – after he was found guilty on May 13 of three murders during late-term abortions at his clinic in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Gosnell was also convicted of carrying out 21 terminations after 24 weeks, the legal limit in Pennsylvania. Gosnell’s attorney Jack McMahon said: “We had a fair trial. We got to put out our position and the jury spoke.” . Pennsylvania state law defines a live baby as one that has been fully expelled from the mother and shows signs of life, such as breathing, heartbeat or movement. The judge in Gosnell’s case told the jury that if a baby shows those signs, “that baby is a human being”. Gosnell is due to be sentenced on May 14.
