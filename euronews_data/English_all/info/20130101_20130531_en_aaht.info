# ORIG TITLE    Police fire plastic bullets in fifth night of Belfast unrest . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Hundreds of loyalists picketed Belfast City Hall on Monday night in their continuing protest over the Union flag. The unrest has been triggered by a decision to end the century-old tradition of flying the British flag from the City hall every day. But the largely peaceful gathering was in complete contrast with disturbances which again broke out for a fifth night elsewhere in Northern Ireland’s capital. With police blaming paramilitary groups for raising the level of violence, officers fired plastic bullets after being attacked with petrol bombs and fireworks. The province’s police chief has called on political organisers along with parents of youths – some as young as 10 – to reign in the violence.
