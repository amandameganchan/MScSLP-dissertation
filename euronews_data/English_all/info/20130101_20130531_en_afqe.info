Most of the workers at the facility in the industrial district of Dhaka had already gone home for the night at the time. It took firefighters more than three hours to get the blaze under control. The knitwear factory belongs to Tung Hai Sweater Ltd who export clothing to many European countries including the UK, France and Germany.

The fire spread from the iron and zipper section to the rest of the factory.” . The government says it has closed down 18 factories since the collapse of Rana Plaza on April 24. The building housed five facilities making clothing for western countries. The death toll has now climbed to over 900 making the collapse of Rana Plaza the world’s deadliest industrial accident since India’s Bhopal disaster in 1984.
