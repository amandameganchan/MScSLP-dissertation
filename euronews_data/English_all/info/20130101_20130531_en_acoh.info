# ORIG CONTENT  Bulgaria is is to hold early elections to end its political crisis. Prime Minister Boiko Borisov resigned last week over the sometimes violent demonstrations over high electricity prices with thousands accusing the government of being a “Mafia” due to rampant corruption and its failure to improve living standards in the EU poorest state. The protests have already forced some concessions and President Rosen Plevneliev said necessary key changes in the laws should be decided by a new parliament. The outgoing prime minister has now been hospitalised with high blood pressure, adding to a sense of political limbo before an interim government is appointed to lead the country to early elections. Borisov’s departure has failed to fully calm voters. Demonstrations have continued on a smaller scale with large protests planned for the weekend.
