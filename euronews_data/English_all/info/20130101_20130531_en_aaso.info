# ORIG TITLE    Women filmmakers see the light at Sundance . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The Sundance Film Festival is underway in Park City, a ski-resort in Utah. The festival created by actor Robert Redford in 1985 now features over 100 films. This year half of those on show are made by women: . “We don’t predict what is coming. We show what is there. And what comes up will usually give you an indication of changing times. So, even though I am kind of prejudiced, I like the idea that there are more women filmmakers. I think it is time that they had their due, and there should be more of them. And I think what we are seeing is that they are good,” said the famed actor. “May in the Summer,” the U.S. competition opener, is a film by female writer/director Cherien Dabis, “It was very important to me because it is my heritage and I did grow up very aware of the fact that Middle Easterners are very misrepresented and underrepresented and I just wanted to tell a universal story in the Middle East so that we could see the context in the Middle East and yet a story that has nothing to do with the things that we see everyday on the news.” . Palestinian-American Dabis, reverses the perspective on the Middle East, showing a Jordanian woman who has established a successful life in America but undergoes an identity crisis when she returns to her family in Jordan to plan her wedding.
