# ORIG TITLE    There’s “snow” place like home in Slovenia . 
# ORIG CONTENT  We have all heard about castles in the air, but in the region of Carinthia in Slovenia they are more interested in castles in the snow. The goal of building hundreds of ice fortresses is to create a castle fit to tempt fabled King Matjaz out from the underground chamber where he sleeps with his knights. The contest began in 1993 with 8 contestants; this year there were 600.
