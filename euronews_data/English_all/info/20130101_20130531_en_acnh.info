# ORIG CONTENT  Pasta-maker Panzani has become the latest company to be embroiled in the horsemeat scandal. The firm, a subsidiary of Spain’s Ebro foods, said its beef ravioli – produced by French company William Saurin – was the only product affected. It has recalled the ravioli and said anyone who has already bought it will be reimbursed. A Panzani statement said “William Saurin has been the victim of a deception by one of its suppliers.” . The scandal first came to light in January when horse DNA was detected in beefburgers in Britain and Ireland. Horsemeat has now been found in numerous products in many European countries, with one of the latest cases being Ikea meatballs, which were withdrawn on Tuesday February 26. Investigations are currently being conducted by law enforcement agency Europol, while governments across the EU have increased controls and tests on meat products.
