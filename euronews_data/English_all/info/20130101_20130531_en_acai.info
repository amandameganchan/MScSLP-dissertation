# ORIG CONTENT  Anti-government demonstrators have again clashed with police in Bahrain. The latest trouble happened in a Shi’ite village near the capital Manama. The opposition accused security forces of blocking routes leading to the funeral of a protester killed during disturbances on Friday. Police fired tear gas, while demonstrators threw stones and petrol bombs. Earlier on Saturday, officials said police found and defused a bomb on a causeway linking the Gulf island to Saudi Arabia. The series of clashes has followed commemorations by activists of the second anniversary of a pro-democracy revolt. The unrest threatens to undermine new talks between the Sunni-dominated government and the mostly Shi’ite Muslim opposition over its demands for more democracy.
