# ORIG TITLE    Bersani faces tough task to form Italian government . 
# ORIG CONTENT  In Italy, there appears to be little confidence that Pier Luigi Bersani will be able to form a government a month after inconclusive elections. He has been given the tough task of ending the country’s political deadlock but the centre-left leader has already ruled out a broad coalition knowing it could further alienate voters. The election clearly showed that Italians are disenchanted with mainstream parties and largely divided over which forces should the country. “I doubt that Bersani will be able to do it, given the circumstances, everyone is against him, everyone says they will not back him,” said Rome resident, Maria Luigia. Bersani’s position is further complicated because while he enjoys a clear majority in the lower house, the Senate is split. Beppe Grillo, the leader of parliament’s new third bloc, has already rejected a confidence vote to support any established party. But former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, could still play a decisive role. He has called for a grand coaltion to be formed however Bersani has ruled out working with the head of the country’s second biggest bloc, who is still fighting several legal cases.
