# ORIG TITLE    Jabal Bedro – a Syrian town under siege . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The casualty figures coming out of Syria are constantly alarming. But life for those left behind is also tragic in Jabal Bedro, a district of the country’s largest city Aleppo. Over the past three days it has been heavily bombed with scud missiles of Bashar al Assad’s regime. People here are trying to recover what they can and there is always the grim fear of finding bodies amidst the rubble which only adds to the widespread anger that ordinary people are being targeted. “They’re firing on us as if we were Israelians,” one young boy told euronews. “They’ve destroyed our brothers and 50 people have been martyred in my family alone,” he added. What is left of some people’s personal effects and everyday items can be clearly seen amid the debris. Cleaning up, serves a useful purpose in helping people maintain their dignity although many people have to move almost everyday with a handful of objects and affairs to stay safe and try to restablish a semblance of normality. No one knows the exact number of dead, but they know that when the scuds fell, the majority of the victims were women and children sleeping at the moment of impact, around 2130 local time. “We left the house after hearing an enormous explosion so we went to see. We discovered bodies everywhere. People were screaming and we had no way of helping them,” said Abdul Rahman, a survivor of the bombing. Our correspondent in Aleppo, Pablo Herrera says because of its proximity to the airport, the inhabitants of Jabal Bedro fear this attack could just be the start of a long and bloody destructive period.
