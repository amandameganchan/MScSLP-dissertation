# ORIG TITLE    North Korea threatens ‘merciless’ nuclear strike against US . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The North Korean army says it has received final approval to launch a “merciless” strike on the US, including the possible use of “cutting edge” nuclear weapons. It comes as South Korean intelligence claims Pyonyang has moved a mid-range Musudan missile to the country’s east coast, which would put all of South Korea, Japan and the US territory of Guam in range. US Secretary of State Chuck Hagel is taking the sabre rattling seriously: . “As they have ratcheted up their dangerous rhetoric and some of the actions they have taken over the last few weeks present a real and clear danger.” . In another move North Korea has told South Korean firms operating in the Kaesong industrial zone to withdraw by April 10. The association has asked the North to extend the deadline until April 13, but has yet to receive a reply.
