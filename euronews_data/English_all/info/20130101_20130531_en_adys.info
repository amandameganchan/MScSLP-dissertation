# ORIG TITLE    Italians exasperated by Napolitano’s latest move . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Italy’s President Georgio Napolitano has appointed a group of 10 experts to come up with an economic plan for the country. The main political parties have failed to form a government since inconclusive elections on February 24-25. In Rome, one resident was critical of Napolitano’s move, complaining: “It’s the usual mess – decisions that are totally inadequate and taken with no respect to what the Constitution says. I think all this will lead to an ugly end.” . Another local was worried about the lack of progress, saying: “I hope that we’ll all be OK and that someone will take responsibility.” . “I would have expected the main parties, the Democratic Party, the PDL and Five Star, to have shown some responsibility by now – because we’ve still not reached the bottom, but I am very concerned we soon will,” she continued. President Georgio Napolitano is hoping his 10 ‘wise men’ will be able to develop a policy platform that can win cross-party support and end the political impasse.
