# ORIG TITLE    Dutch search for sarin nerve gas . 
# ORIG CONTENT  In the Netherlands, four people are appearing in court in connection with alleged attempts to trade in the deadly nerve gas sarin. Specialist teams have spent Easter digging up a large area of woodland in the south of the country near Maastricht after conducting surveillance on a suspect. Nothing has been found. The Mayor of Maastricht, Onno Hoes, said that the search operation was carried out without anyone being in danger. The suspects – who are all Dutch, though one has dual Turkish nationality – were detained on suspicion of owning and concealing a lethal gas. A police spokeswoman said they might have been trying to sell the sarin, though it was not clear if a buyer had been lined up. Sarin nerve gas killed 13 people in an attack on the Tokyo underground in 1995.
