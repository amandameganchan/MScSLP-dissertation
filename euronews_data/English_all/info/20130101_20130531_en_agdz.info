# ORIG TITLE    Golan Heights: Fresh tension after Israeli vehicle attacked . 
# ORIG CONTENT  There is fresh tension on the ceasefire line in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Syria says its troops have destroyed an Israeli vehicle which crossed into its territory. Tel Aviv has denied the report, saying a vehicle was hit by gunfire on its side of the ceasefire line. Israel also says that it returned fire after the incident. “First of all our policy on Syria is clear. We are not intervening there, in the civil war,” said Moshe Yaalon, Israeli Defence Minister. “But, as for the situation in the Golan  Heights, we are not allowing and we will not permit, a spillover of fire into our territory. “Overnight, a Syrian army target was  destroyed after gunfire spilled into our  territory in the Golan Heights.” . The incident is the latest on an increasingly fraught frontier. Syria and Israel have traded fire on a number of occasions in recent weeks.
