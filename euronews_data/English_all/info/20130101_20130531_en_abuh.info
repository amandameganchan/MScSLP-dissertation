# ORIG TITLE    France dominate Paris grand slam . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The French contingent proved a dominant force at their home judo Grand Slam in Paris on the second and final day of competition on Sunday. 27-year-old Lucie Louette thrilled the partizan crowd at Bercy by winning the women’s under 78 kilo category. The 2011 European silver medallist needed the full five minutes to beat Akari Ogata of Japan in the final and did so with a yuko – the third highest score achievable in a bout behind an ippon and Waza-ari. Louette was one of three French female judokas to claim gold in Paris out of seven events after Automne Pavia claimed the under 57 kilo class and Clarisse Agbegnenou the under 63 category. The men’s team celebrated two victories in their own capital. One gold came as no surprise as five-time world and current Olympic champion Teddy Riner took top honours in the over 100 kilo division. The 23-year-old wrapped up proceedings by beating Sung-Min Kim of South Korea in just over three minutes. The powerful Frenchman, who was competing for the first time since his Olympic triumph, won gold in style with an ippon – his third judo knockout for this grand slam. David Larose handed the home nation the other men’s gold with victory in the under 66 kilo class.
