# ORIG CONTENT  Human Rights Watch (HRW) . reports that at least 114 civilians were killed by four Syrian government strikes in Aleppo last week. Up to 20 houses were destroyed in each of the blasts. Philippe Bolopion, UN Director at HRW said, “We have absolutely no sign that there were any legitimate military targets in this area. Either the government is deliberately targeting civilians, or at the very least it is acting with a complete disregard for the lives of its own civilians.” . HRW says the Syrian government has started using ballistic missiles in cities. State forces are attempting to suppress an uprising against President Bashar al-Assad that is now approaching its two-year mark. Opposition forces took control of several parts of Aleppo last summer, but have become locked in a stalemate with the Syrian army – which now appears to be taking drastic measures to recapture the city.
