# ORIG TITLE    Senior Bosnian Serb officials jailed for war crimes . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Two men who were high-ranking members of the Bosnian Serb authorities have been jailed for 22 years for war crimes and crimes against humanity during the break up of Yugoslavia. The court in The Hague ruled that Mico Stanisic and Stojan Zupljanin contributed to a plan to ethnically cleanse parts of Bosnia of Muslims and ethnic Croats to make way for a Serb state. In a summary of the verdict, the presiding judge said some of the crimes were committed when Serb forces took over the municipality of Prijedor in 1992 resulting in the deaths of more than 1,000 Muslims and ethnic Croats. The judgement spoke of mass executions at the Omarska and Keraterm detention camps for non-Serbs. The two men had pleaded not guilty to all charges against them at the beginning of the trial in 2009. The political leader of the Bosnian Serbs, Radovan Karadzic and the military commander Ratko Mladic are still on trial at the tribunal in the Hague over atrocities committed during the Bosnian war.
