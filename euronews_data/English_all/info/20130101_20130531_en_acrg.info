# ORIG TITLE    Syria’s al Assad calls UK a “bully” and says it can’t help in crisis . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Syrian president Bashar al Assad has accused the UK of having a “tradition of bullying and hegemony”. In an interview with British paper the Sunday Times, Assad described the UK as not helping to start dialogue between his government and the rebels. “How can we expect to ask Britain to play a role, while it’s determined to militarise the problem. I think they are working against us and against the interest of the UK itself. This government is acting in a naive, confused and unrealistic manner,” said Assad. The foreign ministers of Syria and Iran also struck out at the US, which, for the first time, has said it will give non-lethal aid, such as food and medical supplies, to the Syrian rebels.
