# ORIG TITLE    Relief for Obama as the US avoids the “fiscal cliff” . 
# ORIG CONTENT  US president Barack Obama has given a measured welcome to the news that Congress has averted a fall off the so-called “fiscal cliff”. Politicians in the House of Representatives put aside their political differences to dramatically approve a compromise deal by 257 votes to 167, hoping to head off the hard-core programme of tax rises and spending cuts that kicked in on Tuesday. Obama told reporters at the White House that the agreement is necessary, but not sufficient: . “I am very open to compromise. I agree with Democrats and Republicans that the ageing population and the rising cost of healthcare makes Medicare the biggest contributor to our deficit. I believe we have to find way to reform that programme without hurting seniors who count on it to survive, and I believe that there is further and necessary spending in government that we can eliminate. But we can’t simply cut our way to prosperity, cutting spending has to go hand-in-hand with further reforms to our tax code so that the wealthiest corporations and individuals cannot take advantage of loopholes and deductions that are unavailable to most Americans.” . The fiscal cliff was a self-imposed attempt by US lawmakers to cap spending and increase saving dating back to 2011.
