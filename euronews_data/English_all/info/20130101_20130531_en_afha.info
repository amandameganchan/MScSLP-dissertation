# ORIG CONTENT  US authorities have detained three friends of suspected Boston marathon bomber Dzokhar Tsarnaev. The FBI believes they covered for him in the days after the April 15 blasts. Azamat Tazhayakov and Dias Kadyrbayev, from Kazakhstan, are accused of obstructing the investigation – by removing Tsarnaev’s rucksack from his dorm room at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth three days after marathon attacks. A third student, American Robel Phillipos, is accused of lying to the FBI. Tazhayakov’s father Amir Ismagoulov, speaking a few days before his son’s arrest, says he is not an extremist: . “My son’s never fought anyone. He’s never been in touch with any radicals. He doesn’t go to the mosque, unless we go or there’s another reason. He’s never been to a mosque in the US.” . But radical or not, the police report says the young Kazakh and his friend removed a rucksack containing a laptop, vaseline and fireworks from Tsarnaev’s dormroom – after they saw a photo of him on TV in connection with the bomb attacks in April. When Tsarnaev’s friends texted him to say they had seen his picture on TV, he allegedly replied “LOL” and “come to my room and take what you want”.
