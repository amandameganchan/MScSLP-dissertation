# ORIG TITLE    Dozens killed in Afghanistan attack . 
# ORIG CONTENT  More than 50 people have killed in Western Afghanistan in one of the deadliest attacks by insurgents for more than a year. Militants disguised as Afghan soldiers launched a suicide bomb and gun attack at the governor’s compound in Farah province. The Taliban have claimed responsibility saying it was aimed at government employees in Farah who they had “sent several warnings” to telling them not to work there. A Taliban spokesman said they also freed insurgents who were standing trial, though other sources dispute this. Many civilians as well as members of the Afghan security forces were counted among the dead. The attack increases concerns over how Afghan forces will manage when NATO-led troops pull out of Afghanistan next year.
