# ORIG TITLE    Real Madrid eliminate Manchester United from Champions League . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Real Madrid qualified for the quarter-finals of the Champions league on Tuesday night after they beat a ten-man Manchester United 2-1 in the second leg at Old Trafford which sent the Spaniards through 3-2 on aggregate. Sergio Ramos scored an own goal to open the scoring for United before Luca Modric and Cristiano Ronaldo made sure of the win for Jose Mourinho’s men. On a night when Ryan Giggs made his 1,000th competitive appearance United had to wait until three minutes into the second half to break a thrilling first half goalless stalemate. Nani’s rifled cross from inside the box was deflected by Danny Welbeck onto the foot of Ramos who in turn sent the ball past Diego Lopez and into his own net. Sir Alex Ferguson’s side were reduced to ten men on 56 minutes turning the match on its head. Nani was harshly shown a straight red by Turkish referee Cuneyt Cakir for a high challenge on Alvaro Arbeloa despite the Portuguese winger’s eyes being on the ball throughout. Real Madrid immediately made their numerical superiority count. The Spaniards were back on level terms on 66 minutes when former Tottenham star Luca Modric picked up the pace on the edge of the box and unleashed a cracking long range swerving strike to beat United shotstopper David De Gea. Three minutes later Jose Mourninho’s side were in front and on their way to the quarters when Cristiano Ronaldo lunged to meet Gonzalo Higuain’s low cross at the far post and sent the ball it into the back of the net for what turned out to be the last goal of the night and the all-important winner. Elsewhere it was a comfortable win for Borussia Dortmund against Shakhtar Donetsk. Felipe Santana and Mario Goetze were on target in the first half while Jakub Blaszczykowski made the most of a goalkeeping blunder to add a third in the second half to send the German champions through 5-2 on aggregate.
