# ORIG CONTENT  At 29-years-old and after 14 years on the World Cup circuit Tina Maze has just completed her most successful winter to date and she did so in record breaking fashion. The Slovenian completely dominated the season. She won four titles out of six on offer – the coveted overall title, the giant slalom, super-G and combined, and if wasn’t for a weather-induced race cancellation at the World Cup finals last week in Lenzerheide Switzerland the downhill was also in sight. The world’s number one female racer was born in a poor Slovenian mining town near the Austrian border with just a modest little slope to train on. But hard work and a strong ambition for success soon paid off and at the age of 15 she joined the national team and was launched into international competition. Slowly but surely she found her way to the top of the sport and did so in style. After sporadic wins early on it was in 2012 that she sounded the World Cup warning bells with an overall runners up finish – although two silver medals at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics opened some eyes. She then took this season by storm leaving her rivals, notably injury-hit American Lindsey Vonn, in her wake. She won 11 World Cup races and reached the podium 24 times to win her first overall World Cup title with a record-breaking points tally of 2,414. The previous points-total record for a single season was Hermann Maier’s 2,000 points in the year 2000. With her history-making season now behind her focus will be on next year’s winter Olympics where the Maze/Vonn rivalry will no doubt light up the slopes of Sochi.
