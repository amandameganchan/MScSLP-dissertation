# ORIG TITLE    Bachelet in bid for second term as Chile president . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Michelle Bachelet has announced she will run for president of Chile for a second time. She last had the job from 2006-2010, leaving to head up the UN’s women’s agency because Chile’s constitution prevents presidents serving two terms in a row. Bachelet was a popular president, ending her first term with an approval rating of nearly 80 percent. This time she is focusing on income inequality saying she wants a second term to create a country that is: “more just, more united, has more participation and has greater solidarity.” . Bachelet is the best hope for Chile’s centre-left opposition – without her polls show support of around 20 percent. Before taking part in November’s presidential election, Bachelet faces primaries on June 30, possibly becoming the only candidate from the left. : .
