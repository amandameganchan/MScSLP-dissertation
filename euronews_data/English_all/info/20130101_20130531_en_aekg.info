# ORIG TITLE    Spain: New law protects Andalusia’s vulnerable from eviction . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A left wing regional government in Spain has approved a law that will stop banks from repossessing homes from the most needy people, even if there is an eviction notice. Spain’s dire economic crisis has sent unemployment rocketing, and with it arrears on rents and mortgages. The most extreme cases will be protected for three years. Elena Cortés, the regional housing minister said: “To have justice, and to avoid suffering, the change needs to be radical because we are going to the root of the problem. There are now 45 evictions a day in Andalusia, and there are between 700,000 and one million empty homes because of excessive commercialism that reduces a house to just a financial product and something to be speculated on.” . In Madrid, a member of Spain’s General Council of the Judiciary, Gabriela Bravo, said it was positive that the regional government was raising awareness about social exclusion that is making people homeless. “A home is a fundamental right,” she said.
