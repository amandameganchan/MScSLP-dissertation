# ORIG CONTENT  In response to the growing unrest on the streets of Egypt, President Mohammed Mursi has cut short a diplomatic trip to Europe. The streets of Ismailia, Port Said and Suez are thronged with protesters after dark, despite a state of emergency being declared and a curfew imposed. More than 50 people are known to have been killed. Mursi still plans to visit Germany on Wednesday, but the two-day stay has been cut to just a few hours. A subsequent visit to France has been cancelled entirely. The turmoil has shown some signs of easing, but the instability has stirred uneasiness internationally. Mursi will be hoping to help allay fears when he meets Angela Merkel in Berlin. The Chief of Egyptâ€™s armed forces has warned the crisis could end with the collapse of the state. Mourners at the funerals of those killed in Port Said called for the overthrow of the President.
