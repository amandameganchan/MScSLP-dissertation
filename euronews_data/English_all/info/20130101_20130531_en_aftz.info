# ORIG TITLE    Insects food of the future . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Is this the shape of food to come? Most Westerners would be disgusted at the idea of this being a staple food, but for many in the third world bugs and creepy-crawlies already are. Now the World Food Organisation is suggesting that due to pressure on water resources, arable land and the threat of climate change we may all have to reconsider insects in the future, and tuck in. “Insects are very nutritious, they have a high content of protein and minerals and fats, so they are very important for the local populations in many developing countries, in Asia, Africa and Latin America, and they actually already play a major role in the food security of the people because two billion people in the world, that means one third of the population of the world, is already eating insects,” says the director of the FAO’s Forestry Economics Policy and Product Division. More than 1900 insect species already find their way onto people’s plates around the world. And not just in the underdeveloped world. Denmark’s former world number one restaurant, Noma, famously serves ants and fermented grasshoppers, and prepared properly taste is not an issue. One restaurant in San Francisco does a roaring trade in termite tacos and the like, but don’t expect Kentucky Fried Centipede anywhere near you, soon.
