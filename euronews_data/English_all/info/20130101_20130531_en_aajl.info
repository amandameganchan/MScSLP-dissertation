# ORIG TITLE    Big TVs are king at 46th CES . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Las Vegas’s 46th annual International Consumer Electronics Show is showcasing the technology trends of the near and distant future. Thousands of exhibitors attract more than 150,000 people to see the industry`s upcoming products ranging from cellphones to giant televisions. This year HD televisions that promise four times the picture resolution of current TVs are among the stars. Sony and Samsung are among the tech giants looking to set the pace for the “Ultra HD” or “HD 4K” market. Japanese giant Sony seems revived at this year’s show. Its just-over 19,000 euro 4K TV really does look more vibrant and real than life itself. “The main thing this year is TVs, HDTVs, either 4K, which they are also calling ultra high definition or OLED TVs. The 4K TVs we are seeing from everyone across the board. I saw, at least eight different 4K Ultra high definition TVs yesterday,” said CNET editor Donald Bell. Sony’s new 5-inch smartphone, the Xperia Z, has a high resolution camera and a powerful core processor. South Korea’s Samsung is betting super-large TVs with over 65-inch screens will lead growth. It has produced three ultra high-definition TVs that boast four times better picture quality than full HD models, and catch-up ‘Evolution’ kits updating 2012 TV’s with this year’s smart technology. The driverless car is also among the hot items this year at CES. Google, Audi and Toyota say challenges remain, but believe it can be done. “Ultimately, there will be a driverless vehicle. But, for now, being realistic about it, we believe that driverless autonomy is not just driverless yet,” says Toyota’s Jim Pisz. “Connectivity” remains the buzzword at CES, with electronic makers displaying the ability to connect everything in your home and car through your smart phone.
