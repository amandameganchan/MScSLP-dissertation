# ORIG TITLE    Lufthansa deal ends costly strikes . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Following two days of negotiations, Lufthansa has struck a deal with workers, putting an end to recent strikes. In addition to ground staff, the agreement covers workers at the Lufthansa Systems, Lufthansa Technik and Lufthansa Cargo units, according to the union that represents them – Verdi. All are in line for pay increases between three and 5.2 percent within the next two years and in two stages. The resolution of the dispute means no more of the industrial action that has cost Europe’s second-largest airline an estimated 15 million euros. The German carrier is cutting 3,500 jobs in a bid to increase profits. A walkout on April 22 by 14,000 staff caused the cancellation of 99 percent of Lufthansa’s European services that day.
