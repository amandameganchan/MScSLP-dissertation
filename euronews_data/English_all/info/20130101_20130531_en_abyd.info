# ORIG TITLE    Bahrain uprising anniversary: Worst clashes in months . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Two years after their Arab Spring uprising against Bahrain’s ruling family, protesters have been back on the streets in what they said was a day of civil disobedience. Security forces fired warning shots to try to disperse a crowd of youths gathered in a village near the capital Manama. They killed a teenager and several others were injured during the most violent clashes in months. Thousands of people were arrested during the first uprising in early 2011. Dozens of political prisoners are still in jail. Of those originally detained, seven prisoners have been interviewed by Amnesty International at Bahrain’s Jaw prison. All of them say they’ve been jailed on false charges or under laws that repress basic rights. Many were allegedly tortured in the first weeks of their arrests. Human rights groups also claim security forces used excessive force two years ago.
