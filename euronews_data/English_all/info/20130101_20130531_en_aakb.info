# ORIG TITLE    Israel shivers under heavy snowfall . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Jerusalem has virtually ground to a standstill after Israel’s worst snowstorm for 20 years. Up to 15 centimetres fell overnight, forcing public transport and schools to shut down. The city’s emergency department urged residents to stay at home and make it a day with the family. On the roads, many vehicles which had ventured out got stuck. The main highway between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv was reported to be blocked. There has been severe weather in the West Bank too where hail, snow and heavy rain brought flooding and landslides. Four Palestinians died. Dozens of houses were flooded in the Gaza Strip. In the north of Israel along the border with Lebanon, much of the Galilee region was paralysed by the rare wintry conditions with 30 centimetres of snow reported in the city of Safed.
