# ORIG TITLE    Benedict bids farewell . 
# ORIG CONTENT  As the curtain falls on Pope Benedict XVI’s papacy, he bade a personal farewell to the College of Cardinals, his closet confidants during his eight years as Bishop of Rome. He made the following vow to his successor: “Among you there is the new Pope, to whom I today declare my unconditional reverence and obedience.” . The 85-year-old, who resigned his post due to ‘mental and physical frailty’, spoke of a joyous and difficult pontificate: “In these past eight years we have lived with faith – beautiful moments of radiant light in the path of the Church, as well as moments when some clouds darkened the sky.” . The focus now shifts to the Cardinals, who will elect the next pope. Until a decision is reached, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone will take charge of Vatican affairs and the world’s 1.2 billion Roman Catholics.
