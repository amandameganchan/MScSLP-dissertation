# ORIG CONTENT  Two men have been arrested after British fighter jets escorted a Pakistani passenger plane to Stansted Airport near London. The Pakistan International Airlines craft was en route from Lahore to Manchester in the north of England. A passenger told reporters that after the plane landed, the pilot announced there had been a threat, which is why they had put down early. Police went onboard and handcuffed and removed two men, reported to be aged 30 and 41. They are being held on suspicion of endangerment of an aircraft. It comes just hours after a BA plane was forced to make an emergency landing after an engine caught fire. The incidents were not related. Britain is on high alert following the killing of a soldier in London on Wednesday.
