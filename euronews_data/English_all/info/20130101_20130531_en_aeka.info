# ORIG TITLE    Let the American gun debate begin . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The US Senate has voted to open talks on Obamaâ€™s bill to curb gun violence. It is one small step, but it is the furthest proposals on gun control have gone since 1994. The vote came after a compromise was found over background checks, which appear to be the best chance to get legislation passed. Though many obstacles remain and the issue has divided America. Advocates of the bill were in Washington with impassioned pleas of support. However, some Americans feel that any gun-control legislation would infringe their constitutional right to bear arms. The debate is set to last weeks with many amendments thrown up to strike a balance between the battling opinions.
