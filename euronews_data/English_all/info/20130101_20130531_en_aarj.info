# ORIG TITLE    Belgian doctors euthanaise deaf and blind twins . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The debate over euthanasia has erupted once again in Belgium following the death by lethal injection of two twin brothers who were deaf and blind. The pair who had lived and worked together all their lives had requested to be put to sleep after being unable to bear not to see and hear each other. The 45-year-olds were given lethal injections at a hospital in Brussels last month after having a cup of coffee together and saying their goodbyes. But the case has tested the boundaries of Belgiumâ€™s law on assisted suicide which was legalised in 2002. In 2011, more than 1,100 people were granted the right to die. Almost all were above 60 years old and most had cancer. Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland have decriminalised euthanasia.
