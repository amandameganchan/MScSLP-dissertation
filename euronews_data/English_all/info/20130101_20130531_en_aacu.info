Heavy rains and gusts of winds of up to 140 kilometres per hour continue to lash the French territory. Both of the island’s airports have been closed and around 25,000 homes are without electricity after falling trees cut power lines. Dumile was expected to become a full cyclone as it passed over the island. Locals and tourists had been told to stock up on emergency supplies and remain indoors. Lying west of Madagascar, Reunion has a population of around 800,000. The island is also visited by several hundred thousand tourists each year. Its other neighbour, Mauritius, which lies about 200 kilometres northeast, is also watching Dumile’s progress.
