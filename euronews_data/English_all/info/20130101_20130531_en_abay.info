According to Khan, the sequel is bigger and better than the original. “There was a degree of security and insecurity. I was secure in the fact that I thought, you know, we have a good thing going, but I was also a bit worried whether we would be able to make a better film and my focus was on upgrading everything in terms of script and the look of the movie and the performances,” ha says. Set against the horseracing backdrops of Dubai and Durban, the film features an ensemble Bollywood cast, including Deepika Padukone, John Abraham and Jacqueline Fernandez. “The second one has been approached almost like a revenge drama in the first half of the movie and in the second half it’s like a heist film. So, those were the two exciting scenarios that the writers felt would suit the character. It’s kind of further adventures of this guy, with the similar kind of ingredients as the first one – like beautiful women that you can’t trust because they are probably lying to you and people pretending to be things that they’re not and that sort of thing,” says Khan.
