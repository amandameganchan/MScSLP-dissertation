# ORIG TITLE    Accused Cleveland kidnapper appears in court and bailed for $8m . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The man accused of imprisoning three women in Cleveland, Ohio, has had his bail set at eight million US dollars – more than six million euros. Ariel Castro, 52, made his first court appearance but entered no plea to the charges of kidnap and rape. His brothers Pedro, 54, and Onil Castro, 50, appeared at the same court facing unrelated charges. Police say they were not involved in the crimes against the women. Ariel Castro is the owner of the house where Amanda Berry, Michelle Knight and Gina DeJesus were held for years. Knight and DeJesus were found in the property after Berry, 27, escaped on Monday. Berry arrived at her sister’s home in Cleveland on Wednesday, and the press have been asked to allow the family their privacy. Dejesus, 23, who went missing at the age of 14, has also returned home. Knight, 32, remains in hospital and reportedly has hearing damage and severe facial injuries. The women were kept in Castro’s house for up to a decade – a property where police have found 200 items of evidence including ropes and chains.
