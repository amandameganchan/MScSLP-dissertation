# ORIG TITLE    World goes green for St Patrick’s Day . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Ireland has put aside its economic travails to celebrate the day of its national Saint, St Patrick. The streets of Dublin were a sea of green as young and old turned out to mark the occasion. It has been a five day affair, with 8,000 visitors from around the world joining in a people’s parade. This year the celebrations are also global. Seventy monuments worldwide – including the Pyramids and Rio’s Christ the Redeemer statue – have been lit up green. Prime Minister Enda Kenny has taken 19 of his ministers on a goodwill trip to sell the Irish brand abroad. Grateful that more than 13 million pints of Guinness will be quaffed across the world in just one day, Guinness is offering a free visit to its Dublin factory to everyone called Patrick.
