# ORIG CONTENT  In Cairo at least one person has died and 65 injured as violence erupted in response to Saturday’s court ruling on last years football stadium riot in which more than 70 people were killed. The headquarters of the Egyptian Football Association in the capital were set ablaze by fans of the local Al-Ahly team who had been playing in the stadium at Port Said. Most of the victims who died were supporters of the Cairo team, and fans vented their anger at the court decision with some threatening further violence if more people were not charged. Other buildings were torched including a police social club and a fast food outlet. A police helicopter scooped up water from the nearby Nile river and dropped it on the buildings in a bid to bring the fires under control. There are reports Molotov cocktails were uncovered in the social club which had not ignited. Our correspondent Mohammed Shaikhibrahim in Cairo says: “ Angry demonstrations and burning of government buildings is the scene that Cairo woke up to today, after the court’s decision on the football fans from Port Said, the decision satisfied some, but did not prevent the anger of others.” .
