# ORIG TITLE    French Minister leading tax evasion crackdown resigns after formal investigation launched . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A formal investigation has been opened into the former French Budget Minister Jerome Cahuzac following allegations he had a secret Swiss bank account. President Francois Hollande accepted his resignation on Tuesday evening. Suspicions were raised in December when the former plastic surgeon, who is heading a drive to crack down on tax evasion, was accused of holding an account at UBS until the start of 2010 by an investigative reporter. It was alleged the male voice on a recorded telephone call published online admitting holding the account was Cahuzacâ€™s. That now appears to have been confirmed by a police laboratory. A formal investigation means prosecutors are able to deploy greater resources, notably in Switzerland, to prove their case.
