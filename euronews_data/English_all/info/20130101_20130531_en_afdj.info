# ORIG CONTENT  An explosion thought to have been caused by a gas leak has ripped through a building in the centre of the Czech capital Prague. First reports say around 20 people have been injured, four seriously. Several people are said to be trapped in the rubble. About 15 are reported to have been inside when the blast happened. Eyewitnesses quoted by Czech media said the smell of gas was detectable in the street beforehand. Some of the injured were hurt by flying glass when windows in neighbouring buildings shattered. One news agency says the building housed an office of the International Air Transport Association and an art gallery. The immediate area has been evacuated.
