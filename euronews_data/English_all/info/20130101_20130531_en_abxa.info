# ORIG TITLE    Libya fears Islamist incursions, seeks help to secure borders . 
# ORIG CONTENT  French President François Hollande has held talks with Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zeidan in Paris with the leaders debating Libyan calls for Western and Arab allies to help secure the country’s borders. There are concerns that defeated Islamist rebels, fleeing French forces in Mali, will enter Libyan territory, further destabilising the oil producer. On Tuesday France hosted delegations from the US, Britain, Arab nations, the UN and EU working on finding practical ways of creating a more stable Libya, but nothing appears to have been decided. Paris, London, Ankara and others did agree to provide technical support to help seal the borders, but more is needed to secure the 4,000 kilometre frontier. The EU is also concerned about internal security and urged its nationals to leave the eastern city of Benghazi, which was the scene of the attack on the US diplomatic mission that left US Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three others dead last September.
