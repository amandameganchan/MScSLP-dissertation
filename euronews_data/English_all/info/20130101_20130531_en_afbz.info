# ORIG TITLE    Italian PM restores calm over carabinieri shooting . 
# ORIG CONTENT  First the confusion…then the reaction. After a man was arrested for shooting and injuring two national military police, known as carabinieri, outside the government headquarters in Rome, the country’s Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister stepped up to handle his first task. Angelino Alfano was thrust into the spotlight and quickly moved to reassure the country. Speaking at a press conference, he said: . “An initial examination of the incident suggests that this can be considered an isolated act. A new investigation has begun concerning this act. “It’s my duty to say that the general situation of public order in Italy isn’t in any danger. But in any event, we’ve increased security measures in vulnerable locations,” added Alfano. In a show of compassion and solidarity with the victims, Alfano paid a visit to the injured carabinieri. Italy has surely had more auspicious starts to a government that many have tipped to fail.
