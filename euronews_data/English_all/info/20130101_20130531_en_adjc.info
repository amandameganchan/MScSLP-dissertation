# ORIG TITLE    Baghdad: 10 years after the US-led invasion . 
# ORIG CONTENT  March 2013 marks ten years since the United States led an invasion of Iraq to remove leader Saddam Hussein. Investment has increased since Hussein’s overthrow – but many Iraqis complain the government is not doing enough to raise living standards. In the centre of Baghdad, new roads and shopping malls are testaments to the improved economy – driven by a surge of investment in the oil sector. Iraq is now the second biggest producer in the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) . At a Baghdad fairground with her husband and two young children, Baidar Ta’ar said: “Honestly, it’s all the same. All we want is security. Things aren’t bad, but we do need security for our children – nothing more, nothing less. The situation changes from time to time. Sometimes it’s safe, and we say there’s nothing to worry about. Then sometimes it isn’t safe. It’s difficult.” . Abdul Aziz al-Kubeisi, who watched as Saddam Hussein’s state fell nearly a decade ago said: “Really. nothing has changed. Things have gone from bad to worse. In Baghdad you can see that for yourself.” . In a shanty town near the al-Rasul district, people are living without electricity, running water or public services. For the people living there, the boost to Iraq’s economy since the US-led invasion seems a million miles away.
