# ORIG CONTENT  Bayern’s players were received with applause from fans in Munich on Wednesday, one day after Thomas Mueller scored a brace to hand his side a convincing 4-0 win over Barcelona in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final at the Allianz Arena. The Catalans, winners of the trophy in 2009 and 2011, had no answer to Bayern’s power as Mario Gomez and Arjen Robben were also on target to inflict Lional Messi’s team-mates their heaviest defeat for almost six years. Despite the result, Bayern, who are bidding to become the first German team to win the treble of European, league and cup titles, know how tough life could be at the Camp Nou, having lost 4-0 on their last Champions League visit to Barcelona in 2009. Tito Vilanova’s men will host Bayern on April 1 for the second leg.
