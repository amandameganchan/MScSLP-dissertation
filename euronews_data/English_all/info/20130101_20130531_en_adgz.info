The European plane makers’ Chief Executive Fabrice Bregier said it is worth 18.4 billion euros: “We will be sealing the largest single order ever recorded by Airbus to date, both in terms of value and number of aircraft involved”. Lion Air Chief Executive Rusdi Kirana added: “Today we declare our commitment and optimism to make a bold decision for the future with this firm order of 234 aircraft from Airbus” .

Indonesia’s domestic aviation market, serving the world’s fourth largest population, is growing at 21 percent annually.

President Francois Hollande said: “The big Airbus contracts are an example for our economy of what it can do, what it must do, in terms of competitivity, in terms of research and innovation. In terms of training of personnel, also in terms of commercialisation.” .
