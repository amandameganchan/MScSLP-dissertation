# ORIG CONTENT  The woman who talked to the attackers of the soldier in London has described how she tried to calm them down. Ingrid Loyau-Kennett is originally from France, and is a cub scout leader. She approached the two men who were still on the scene near the body of the man on a street in south east London. “Well I saw a man on the road, obviously injured, and a car badly crashed. So I assumed it was a road accident. When I approached the body there was a lady cradling him and then the guy, the most excited one of the two, said ‘don’t go too close to the body’. I thought ‘OK’ and because I was down I could see a revolver, a butcher’s knife and do you know this axe the butchers have to cut – yea that’s what he had. And blood all over him and I thought ‘what the heck happened here?’. And I though OK obviously he was a bit excited and the thing was just to talk to him. He said, ‘don’t touch, I killed him’. I said ‘Why ?’ He said, “He’s a British soldier he killed people he killed Muslim people in Muslim countries and he have nothing do to here’. So I tried to make him talk about what he felt.” . Reporter: “Were you not scared for yourself in that situation ?” . “No!” . Reporter: “Why not?” . “Better me than a child, because unfortunately there more and more mothers with children stopping around, by,so it was even more and more important that I talked to him asking what he wanted.” . Ingrid Loyau-Kennett has been commended for her bravery by the London Police.
