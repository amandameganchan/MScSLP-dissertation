Primark which occupied a floor of the eight story building has called on other retailers to offer help. Bangladeshi manufacturers met representatives of leading Western brands on Monday to discuss safety standards following the disaster which has left at least 400 dead. The illegally constructed complex housed five clothes factories before it caved in. Earlier the owner of the building was led into court. Eight people have now been arrested over the incident, including factory bosses who ordered employees to work ignoring safety warnings . Angry crowds are demanding harsh punishments for those responsible including the death penalty. Efforts to find survivors have now turned to recovering the bodies of those still missing.
