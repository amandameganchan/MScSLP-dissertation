# ORIG TITLE    Protests fail to stop traffic on the Suez Canal . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A fire on the quay side at Port Said has failed to disrupt shipping on the Suez Canal. Protesters also untied speedboats hoping they would drift into the waterway and disrupt passing vessels. Officials reported ships were passing as usual. The protests were sparked by a court ruling which confirmed death sentences handed down to 21 local soccer fans for their part in a stadium riot last year. “The Security Commander of Port Said, the Interior minister, the Governor of Port Said, the officers of Port Said intelligence, one by one, and the security that was surrounding the club; those are the ones that need to be executed, and they’re the ones who will say the truth,” said one protester. Demonstrations and clashes with police have been common in the city which lies at the northern entrance to the canal since the death sentences were first announced in January but this is the first time the waterway was targeted. At least eight people have been killed this week, including three policemen. In an effort to ease the tension the army was drafted in to maintain security in place of the police hated by many Egyptians since the Mubarak era.
