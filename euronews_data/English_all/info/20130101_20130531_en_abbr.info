# ORIG CONTENT  Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is planning legal action against the Spanish newspaper El Pais for publishing a “false photo” of him on its front page. The paper’s bosses have now apologised. They thought had a scoop as Chavez, who is undergoing cancer treatment, has not been seen for several weeks. But the photo was not of him.
