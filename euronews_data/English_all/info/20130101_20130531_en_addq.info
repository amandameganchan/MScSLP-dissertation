# ORIG TITLE    New day: new pope . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The Roman Catholic Church has a new leader: Argentine Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio was elected Pope Francis on March 13. The huge crowds that filled Saint Peter’s Square for the announcement had disappeared by the next morning. While the news teams that had filled the historic square packed up to move onto the next big story, Francis’ papacy began. The 76-year-old from Buenos Aires started his first day with a visit to a Rome’s Santa Maria Maggiore Basilica, for a private prayer. His first few days will included audiences with his staff, the media – and of course, his flock. He is also expected to visit his predecessor Benedict – who resigned last month. The new pope takes the helm of a Roman Catholic Church plagued by scandals over sex abuse – as well as allegations of corruption and infighting.
