# ORIG TITLE    Bolshoi Ballet dancer admits acid attack . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A top dancer at Moscow’s Bolshoi Theatre has admitted plotting an acid attack that nearly blinded the troupe’s artistic director Sergei Filin. It follows the alleged confessions of involvement made by the driver Andrei Lipatov and the suspected attack Yuri Zarutsky. Ballet soloist Pavel Dmitrichenko was taken into custody yesterday along with the other suspects. After his arrest, Dmitrichenko said he masterminded the attack but not what eventually happened. The assault came after a period of infighting behind the scenes at the Bolshoi and Dmitrichenko’s apparent confession already has many doubters in Moscow. “I do not believe in it. I know Pavel, I work in the Theatre. No, no, he is a ballet solist in Bolshoy, so why would he damage his career,” said one woman. “This is of course disgusting. You absolutely cannot imagine that people working in art may even think that way,” opined one man. Filin’s eyes suffered burns after a masked attacker threw sulphuric acid in his face outside his Moscow flat in January. The artistic director was released from hospital last month for further treatment in Germany and it is thought he will be back at work this summer.
