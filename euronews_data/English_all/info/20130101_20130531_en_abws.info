# ORIG TITLE    PSG and Juventus enjoy important away wins . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Paris Saint Germain and Juventus both took a step closer to progressing the quarter finals of the Champions league following away wins in their last 16 first leg ties. Big-spending PSG safely negotiated their trip to Spain with a two – one win against Valencia at the Mestalla. With new signing David Beckham eagerly watching from the stands Ezequiel Lavezzi opened up the scoring for the French capital club after just ten minutes. Argentine international Javier Pastore hit home the second for Carlo Ancelotti’s men two minutes before the break while Adil Rami offered some hope for next month’s return leg on the 90th minute. Although nothing is done and dusted PSG should now head into the second leg on the seventh of March in Paris confident of reaching the quarter-finals since 1995. Juventus beat Celtic 3-0 in Glasgow to almost assure themselves a quarter-final place. The Serie A leaders silenced a packed out Celtic Park in the first three minutes when Alessandro Matri hit the opener past Fraser Forster. Matri was involved in the second when his neat through ball was picked up by Claudio Marchisio who calmly rounded one defender to blast the ball home. Mirko Vučinić added to Celtic’s miserable night when the Italians took full advantage of a defending error by the Scotts on the edge of the box.
