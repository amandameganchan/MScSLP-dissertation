# ORIG TITLE    Wilko Johnson’s farewell tour . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Wilko Johnson, the cult guitarist from Dr Feelgood, is performing a series of farewell concerts in the UK, having announced that he is dying of pancreatic cancer. He was philosophical about the deadly illness: “I feel absolutely fit. It’s just that I can feel this lump here and I know it’s going to kill me. It just makes everything much more intense, you know. Just walking down the street can be pretty good. You think: ‘Wow, I am walking down the street – it’s great!’ Because normally we don’t think. Everybody’s going to die but generally it’s something for the future, you put it off. I mean I am sure that people who are 99 years old think of it that way — it’s something in the future. But when you’ve more or less been given a date, it makes things a bit different.” . The 65-year-old British musician and actor can look back on a career of more than 40 years during which he has played and collaborated with the likes of Ian Dury and The Stranglers.
