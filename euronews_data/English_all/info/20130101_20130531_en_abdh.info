# ORIG TITLE    Killing continues at Port Said funerals . 
# ORIG CONTENT  There has been no let up in the killing at Port Said in Egypt. An 18 year old was shot dead as mourners blocked the streets to bury 33 protesters killed in violence at the weekend. They were the latest to die in a chain of events that began with a football stadium tragedy last February. More than 70 died then when the match in Port Said descended into violence. On Saturday, a court ordered 21 of those accused in connection with the violence be put to death, and that sparked the latest round of bloodshed as protesters vented their fury about fellow citizens being blamed. The outpouring of anger and violence overnight led to the Egyptian army putting the city into virtual lock-down. There was violence too where the condemned were held. Two police officers were reported killed as relatives tried to storm the jail and free the defendants.
