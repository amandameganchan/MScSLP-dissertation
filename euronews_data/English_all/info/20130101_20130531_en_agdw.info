# ORIG TITLE    Joint probe into Russia’s Eurovision votes ‘stolen’ in Azerbaijan . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Russia and Azerbaijan are joining forces to investigate a Eurovision scandal that saw votes for Russia’s entry vanish. Moscow’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has described as “outrageous” the revelations by Azerbaijan that although its country’s voters had put Dina Garipova’s ballad second, she got “nul points” instead of ten. At a joint news conference in Moscow, Azerbaijan’s Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov spoke of his government’s “shock” when the data was published. On Monday Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev ordered an inquiry. The head of the country’s public broadcaster said he was “very worried and surprised” by the breakdown of the votes. Eurovision fans in each of the 39 countries voted by text or phone and their collective votes counted 50-50 with those of a professional jury. Russia’s ten “lost” votes made no difference to the final outcome. Its song came fifth, 17 points behind fourth-placed Norway.
