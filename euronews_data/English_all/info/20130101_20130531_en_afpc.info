# ORIG TITLE    Rock roundup . 
# ORIG CONTENT  After decades of singing covers, Rod Stewart has released a new album of original material called “Time”. Rod Stewart said: “It was probably the longest writer’s block in history, you know, 20-odd years. But it wasn’t self-imposed. It was maybe a lack of confidence. Songwriting always used to be you know like work for me. It was never a pleasure. It was never a joy. It was like being at school. But now I finally enjoy it. You know my wife will tell you, I’m getting up in the middle of the night and writing down lyrics and just inspired, you know.” . Rod Stewart has been married to Penny Lancaster for six years and many of the new tracks – 11 out the 12 on the album were written by Rod Stewart – deal with his personal life. Rod Stewart will be touring this summer to promote his new album Time. Depeche Mode have started their world tour with a date in Tel Aviv. They are promoting their new album Delta Machine. The tour will include 34 European dates before they head over the Atlantic to North America.
