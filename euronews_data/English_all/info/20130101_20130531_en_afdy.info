# ORIG TITLE    China takes PC crown from US . 
# ORIG CONTENT  China has knocked the United States off the number one spot in yet another area. First it was cars, now it’s personal computers. The research firm IHS reported 69 million PCs were shipped there last year. That was three million more than the US. And it seems the Chinese are still keen on desktop computers as they accounted for half the total, whereas laptops are more popular in the rest of the world. IHS said that was because of the huge demand in China’s rural areas. China’s PC market is projected to grow only three or four percent this year as people move to using mobile phones.
