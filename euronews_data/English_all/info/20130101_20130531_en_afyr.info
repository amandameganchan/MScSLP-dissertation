# ORIG TITLE    Poland: Baby born 15 times over drink drive limit . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A new-born baby is in a critical condition in hospital in Poland after being born with 2.9 grams of alcohol in its blood – which is almost 15 times the adult drink drive limit. The baby girl’s 38-year-old mother is said to have gone into labour while intoxicated and was taken to a hospital in the city of Tomaszow Mazowiecki. Doctors called police when the mother, who is said to have been visibly drunk, checked in at the hospital. A police spokeswoman said: “A blood test showed that the 38-year-old woman had a level of 1.2 grams of alcohol at the time of birth.” 1.2 grams of alcohol is the equivalent of a bottle of wine or two litres of beer in an adult body but the effect of alcohol is compounded in babies. Consequently, the new-born was found to have a level of 2.9 grams, police said. The blood-alcohol limit for drivers in Poland is 0.2 grams. There are no immediate fears for the baby’s life but doctors are concerned about her development. The mother could face charges of endangering the life and health of her child, a crime which carries a sentence of up to five years in prison.
