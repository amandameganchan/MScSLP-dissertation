# ORIG TITLE    Cannes 2013: suspense, stars, thefts… and movies . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Twelve days and nights are drawing to a close: days and nights of drama and suspense, celebrities and parties, the odd jewellery theft – and of course, plenty of rain. The 66th Cannes Film Festival will be remembered for its unseasonal weather. Above all there were the films: films about love, sex, violence, family breakup, and other emotional anguish. Euronews has been seeking out the opinions of some of those covering the event. “There were some great directors among the final choice, and so there were some great scenes. They’re scenes which have shown some very interesting themes, notably homosexuality,” said Katalin Venczel of the Hungarian news agency MTI. “This year’s festival edition lived up to all expectations, it was an audacious festival, we discovered new names, and as almost always, sex and violence characterised the official selection of films,” was the assessment of David del Rio from Mexico’s Agencia Notimex. A number of movies were praised for deviating from the Hollywood orthodoxy. Television was accepted as having had a positive influence on cinema. Alan Schoenauer, a freelance French photographer covering Cannes since 1982, said: “It’s been an exceptional year with exceptional arrivals up the steps each night, and with the jury, the stars, and some amazing moments of emotion each time.” . While the attention of the public at large remained fixed on the stars and the films on offer, behind the scenes industry professionals did thousands of business deals. They will all be back next year.
