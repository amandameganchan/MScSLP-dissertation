# ORIG TITLE    Amanda Knox ponders return to Italy for retrial . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Amanda Knox, the US student tried for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher in 2007, is considering a return to Italy to face a retrial. In her first TV interview since being cleared in 2011 after four years in jail, Knox protested her innocence and said her experience was surreal and could have happened to anyone. Describing her ordeal on ABC TV said she just wants to be considered a person and not the devil she’s been portrayed as in the media. A memoir of her experience entitled “Waiting to be Heard”, for which she has received an advance of 3.8 million dollars (almost 2.9 million euros) is out soon.
