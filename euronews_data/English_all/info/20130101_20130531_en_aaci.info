# ORIG CONTENT  A fresh attempt is being made to salvage a drilling ship which ran aground in Alaska on New Year’s Eve in “near hurricane” conditions. There is no sign of a hull breach but experts say it is too early to tell when the stricken Kulluk rig can be recovered. It is a vital part of Royal Dutch Shell’s controversial Artic oil drilling programme, which has encountered several problems. The US Coast Guard said the Kulluk is now “upright and stable” on Sitkalidak Island in the Gulf of Alaska. Salvage experts have been aboard it for a structural assessment.
