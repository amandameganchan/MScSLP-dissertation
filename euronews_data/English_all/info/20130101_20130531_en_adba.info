# ORIG TITLE    Former British Energy Secretary starts jail sentence . 
# ORIG CONTENT  “No doubt you thought that you could get away with it”. So said the judge to Chris Huhne, Britain’s former energy secretary before being taken by van to begin a jail sentence for perverting the course of justice. The former politican was sentenced for trying to evade a speeding fine, with the help of his then wife. Speaking in an interview on British television, Chris Huhne said: “It was a stupid thing to do and I regret doing it, I’m very sorry that I did do it. That’s the grounds of this particular offence – I have inflicted a lot of pain on my family and my ex-wife and I’m very sorry for that”. Huhne’s ex-wife Vicky Pryce also received an 8-month sentence for her part in the cover-up. Under the defence of “marital coercion,” she claimed Chris Huhne forced her to take the speeding points. Huhne was once tipped for the Liberal Democrat leadership. As he sits in his prison cell in Wandsworth Prison, he may well wonder how it all went so horribly wrong.
