# ORIG TITLE    NATO detects ballistic missile launch in Syria . 
# ORIG CONTENT  NATO officials say they have detected the firing of a ballistic missile within Syria landing in the north of the country. There were similar launches on two days last week that prompted the US to call it an escalation of the civil war. It is believed they are targeting Idlib. Newly released pictures purport to show rebels attacking an airport there as part of an attempt to neutralise the Assad regimeâ€™s superior air power. The possibility of missile strikes from Syria has caused concern in neighbouring Turkey. German Patriot anti-missile batteries have been sent to take up position alongside Dutch and American weapons. The latest firings detected in Syria appear to match the characteristics of Scud missiles. But the suffering is not only being caused by bombs and bullets. The winter weather is proving harsh for 12,000 refugees at the Atmah camp within Syria. They have neither electricity nor running water, and limited fuel to burn to keep warm. Hundreds of thousands more have fled to neighbouring countries.
