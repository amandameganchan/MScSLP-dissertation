# ORIG TITLE    Dortmund looking for first leg advantage . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Borussia Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp has urged his side’s fans to put the news of Mario Gotze’s impending transfer to Bayern Munich to one side as they prepare for Wednesday’s Champions League semi-final, first leg against Real Madrid. The timing of the deal does little to help Dortmund who will however have the luxury of naming a full strength lineup for the game. While the German giants are eyeing a second European Cup final, 16 years after downing Juventus in the final in 1997, Madrid are aiming for their 13th final appearance. Former Chelsea coach Jose Mourinho announced on Tuesday Gonzalo Higuain would replace Karim Benzema in attack and confirmed Diego Lopez would continue in goal instead of Spanish international Iker Casillas. This will be the third time the two clubs have met this season with Los Merengues still looking for their first win over Dortmund. The game kicks off at 8.45 local time.
