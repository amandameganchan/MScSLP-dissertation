# ORIG TITLE    Inter-facing up to the future . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The Japanese company, Fujitsu, has developed a piece of next-generation user interface technology which enables intuitive, at-your-fingertips operations. Place a document beneath the device, trace your finger along images or texts, and two inbuilt cameras will detect, scan and store your movements. As Takahiro Matsuda, the Systems Laboratory Research Manager at Fujitsu, explains, in an age where physical documents are increasingly replaced by digital ones, they are attempting to bridge the divide: “I think paper still has its practicability and uses. Today, we need to choose whether to work only with paper documents or only with digital documents. We think it’s important to fuse the advantages of both paper and digital.” . The device can also be combined with a smartphone, so that when a digital copy is read, relevant information about the scanned image appears on-screen. Within medicine, however, the same image-processing technology can be used to determine the varying brightness of a person’s face, thought to depend on blood circulation, and could also be used to check your pulse. As Hidenori Sekiguchi, the Human Centric Computing Laboratories Manager at Fujitsu, explains, this could potentially provide us with live-saving information: “By checking if a person is stressed or relaxed, we can get an idea of the condition of working spaces. Alternatively, it can also be used for security purposes. A person with fast pulse may be a risk.” . Fujitsu plans to evaluate its software applications in real, working environments with the aim of commercializing their product by 2014.
