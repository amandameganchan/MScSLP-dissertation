With the official campaign shut down, election officials geared up as the country decides on the successor to President Hugo Chavez who died in March. Electronic ballot machines were placed in more than 13,000 locations. Officials are keeping a close eye on security. Voting station employees ran multiple tests to ensure the machines, in use since last year, were fully operational. Around 125,000 soldiers will guard polling centres to guarantee voter safety. The Union of Latin American Nations (UNASUR) . representatives were also on hand to ensure a transparent vote. Wilfredo Penco, an electoral observer for UNASUR, described the electoral system as “solid, trustworthy and efficient”. Chavez’s chosen candidate Nicolas Maduro is ahead in the polls. At his last campaign rally crowds chanted for Chavez’s policies to live on. However, Maduro’s opponent Henrique Capriles could make a strong showing.
