# ORIG CONTENT  Karel Schwarzenberg and Milos Zeman, both running for Czech president, have cast their votes in the election’s closely-contested second round. Schwarzenberg, the current Foreign Minister, is heir to one of Central Europe’s wealthiest families. Leftist former Prime Minister Milos Zeman has been a favourite from the start of the election campaign. Polls had not anticipated Schwarzenberg’s strong performance in the first round. Zeman has the backing of the incumbent President Vaclav Klaus, an outspoken euro-sceptic. Whoever wins is expected to pursue a more pro-European agenda. Czechs are participating in their first direct vote for president. The post, which carries more prestige than power, was formerly appointed by parliament. The results are expected on Saturday afternoon.
