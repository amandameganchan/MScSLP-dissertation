# ORIG TITLE    2013 festivities around the world . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The New Year has arrived and so, as the tradition goes, it has been greeted with smiles and good humour around Europe and the world. Once the night-time partying is over however, there is another tradition that needs to be honoured: new year’s resolutions. France 2 spoke to people in Paris to find out what new year’s resolutions they have made. For the next 12 months we will see the number 13 everywhere, a number considered to be unlucky by the superstitious. In Italy RAI2 reports on the measures people are taking in Naples to keep away bad luck and evil spirits. Spaniards in the Puerta del Sol in Madrid celebrate the first day of the year by eating twelve grapes at the strokes of the bell, but children in Barcelona are more interested in the Three Kings who visit to offer them gifts as TVE investigates. Finally we visit Moscow. For new years day there were huge crowds in the streets of the Russian capital who celebrated with a huge firework display. As they follow the Orthodox calender they are also looking forward to Christmas which takes place there on January 6 and 7. RTR travelled around the city to discover all that there is for people to do during this holiday period.
