# ORIG CONTENT  The 15-year-old Pakistani activist, shot in the head by the Taliban last October, says her health is “getting better, day by day.” . Malala Yousefzai gave her first video statement just before undergoing further surgery in Britain at the weekend. It was released on Monday. “God has given me this new life, and this is a second life, this is a new life. And I was to serve. I want to serve the people. And I wanted every girl, every child, to be educated. For that reason, we have organised the Malala fund,” she said. The teenager had been promoting education for girls in the Swat Valley where she lived when she was critically injured. The shooting sparked outrage around the world and Malala even made the shortlist for Time magazine’s “Person of the Year”. Doctors have reconstructed parts of her skull with a titanium plate and restored her hearing. She is expected to remain in the UK for some time.
