# ORIG TITLE    Gay rights demonstration in Croatia . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The issue of gay rights is currently fuelling debate across Europe. In Croatia, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender activists gathered outside Zagreb’s main cathedral. This time, it was not about gay marriage, but education. The government and church are at loggerheads over a new curriculum for state primary schools, with sections on sexual minorities and gender roles. “Over the last month the church has said that gay people are destroying Croatia, that they are destroying humankind. They have called us demons and said we are unnatural and against nature” said one man. Another wanted to know why, if God gives us inspiration, did he then choose homosexuals as artists? People like Michelangelo, Tchaikovsky or Leonardo, he asked. The church has criticised the proposed curriculum. saying it imposes a “gender ideology” upon young children and promotes unnatural lifestyles. Riot police formed a barricade between pro and anti-gay supporters in the square. Three people were arrested.
