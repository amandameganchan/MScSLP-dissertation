# ORIG TITLE    Japan nominates tough-talking central bank boss . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The Bank of Japan seems to be on course to pump more money into the economy as the man who has just been nominated to run it is an advocate of aggressive policy action. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wants the current head of the Asian Development Bank, Haruhiko Kuroda, to take over and boost Japan’s nascent economic upturn. The problem is with Kuroda in charge the central bank’s policies are likely to see the yen fall in value against the dollar and the euro, leading to accusations that Tokyo is engaging in a currency war. The yen is down around 11 percent against the dollar in the last three months, in anticipation of more stimulus. Analyst Brian Jackson with Coutts bank thinks there may be a bit of a pull back in the short-term: “I think that the yen weakness that we have seen over the last couple of months has already been pretty big and there’s already pricing in some fairly aggressive monetary policy changes from the Japanese going forward. So if anything, I expect to see some consolidation and even near-term reversal of some of those yen losses over the next few months.” . The government says any boost to exports from a weaker yen is just a collateral benefit from the main aim which is overhauling monetary policy to revive Japan’s economy after nearly two decades of mild deflation and lacklustre growth.
