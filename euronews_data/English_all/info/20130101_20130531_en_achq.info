# ORIG TITLE    Day 5 of Iberia strike over job cuts . 
# ORIG CONTENT  As Iberia passengers face disruption caused by a fifth day of strike action, the Spanish government says the airline and unions have agreed to bring in a mediator to help resolve the dispute. The walkout is over planned lay-offs, which Iberia says it must make to bring the company to profit again. The company said it had found seats on other flights for most of the 70,000 people affected by the strike. But several travellers at Madrid’s Barajas airport complained about the situation. One woman said, “I guess that they (the workers) have the right to ask for their rights and for what they are asking for, but, as is almost always the case, it’s the passengers who pay in the end.” . A British man said he was unsure how he would get home, “So we’ve just flown in from Sao Paolo and we found that our onward connecting flight to London city airport has been cancelled, so we are not quite sure at the moment how we are actually going to get to London, and even where our bags are.” .
