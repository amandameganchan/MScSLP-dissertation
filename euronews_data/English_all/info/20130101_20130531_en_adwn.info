# ORIG TITLE    Child dies in NATO strike on Afghan Taliban . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A NATO helicopter strike in eastern Afghanistan has killed at least nine suspected Taliban fighters but also one child. A dozen more people were reportedly wounded. There is some confusion over the exact death toll as witnesses claim a toddler was also killed. Initially NATO said the strike was in support of Afghan troops – but later retracted that statement. There is local anger at the number of civilians being caught up in operations against insurgents. Civilian casualties – particularly those caused by air strikes – are a source of friction between President Hamid Karzai and his international allies. Difficult negotiations are continuing over the size of a residual American military presence following the departure of most international troops by the end of 2014.
