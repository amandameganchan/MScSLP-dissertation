# ORIG CONTENT  The M23 rebel group in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo says it will fight back if attacked by a UN contingent being sent to the area. The rebel group, whose full name is the March 23 Movement, is made up of deserters from the Congolese army. The militia claim to have been mistreated whilst in the army and have been fighting in the North Kivu region where up to 700,000 people have been displaced. The country’s government and the UN have accused Rwanda and Uganda of supporting the rebels. UN peacekeepers are already in the region. The UN Security Council has adopted a resolution establishing a special response team. The force will protect civilians and will also carry out ‘offensive and targeted operations’.
