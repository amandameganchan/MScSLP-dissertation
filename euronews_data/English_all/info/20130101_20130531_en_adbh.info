# ORIG TITLE    Cameron calls on world to respect Falklands referendum . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Only three Falkland Islanders voted against the Falklands remaining a British Overseas Territory in the weekend referendum, and there was joy in the capital Port Stanley as the result was announced. Argentina has refused to recognise the vote and claimed it has no legal validity. “The Falkland Islands may be thousands of miles away, but they are British through and through, that is how they want to stay and people should know we will always be there to defend them. I think the most important thing about this result is that we believe in self-determination and the Falkland Islanders have spoken so clearly about their future, and now other countries right across the world, I hope, will respect and revere this very, very clear result,” said British Prime Minister David Cameron. Turnout was more than 90 percent with some of the 1,672 British citizens eligible to vote queuing in the wind and rain to make their voices heard. With no official reaction from Argentina yet, in Buenos Aires a veteran of the 1982 war expressed his point of view. “This situation concerns the whole of Latin America and international opinion. Argentina is asking for dialogue. It’s not saying ‘no.’ Let’s sit down and talk and see what the United Nations has to say,” said Mario Volpe. A total of 255 British and 649 Argentine military personnel died in the 10-week conflict. The Argentines are honoured every year at a ceremony at the memorial in Buenos Aires.
