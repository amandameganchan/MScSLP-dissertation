# ORIG TITLE    First stop London for new US Secretary of State John Kerry . 
# ORIG CONTENT  John Kerry has made his debut at 10 Downing Street. He chose London as his first stop on a nine-nation ‘listening’ tour as the new US secretary of state, a move which appears to have flattered the British Foreign Office. Discussions are expected on the disputed Falkland islands, with both Britain and Argentina laying claim to them. A referendum is on the cards for next month. The US is keeping its distance in the debate. After London he will take in other European capitals where he is expected to meet members of the Syrian opposition. So far the US has offered non-lethal arms to the rebels. Analysts say that Kerry is unlikely to offer new solutions to end the violence which has claimed around 70,000 lives. Kerry will also visit Turkey, Egypt and Saudi Arabia where the Middle East Peace Process will be top of the agenda. A trip to Israel and the Palestinian territories has been planned for later in March when he will be joined by the US president himself.
