# ORIG CONTENT  The FBI has released images of the suspects in Monday’s Boston marathon bombing, appealing to the public for help in identifying two men. At a press conference at a Boston hotel, the FBI agent in charge of the investigation, Richard Deslauriers, showed pictures of the men carrying black rucksacks and described their actions on the day as captured on film. Video footage of the suspects has also been uploaded onto Youtube by the FBI. Deslauriers warned the public not to approach the men who are considered armed and dangerous. “Somebody out there knows these individuals as friends, neighbours, co-workers or family members of the suspects. Though it may be difficult, the nation is counting on those with information to come forward and provide it to us,” said Deslauriers. Meanwhile, investigators continue to examine debris at the scene on Boylston Street. The two devices are believed to have been made by stuffing pressure cookers with nails and ball bearings.
