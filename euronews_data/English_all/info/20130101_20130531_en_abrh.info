# ORIG CONTENT  The latest economic statistics from China show a solid recovery in domestic and overseas demand. Exports grew 20 percent in January from a year earlier while imports surged 28.8 percent, both much higher than forecast. New lending by the country’s banks soared, doubling from December. But economist Wayne Arnold said a lot of the growth comes from government spending and property investment which is risky: “The risks are getting larger. It doesn’t mean we’re going to see a recession in China, or chaos in China, or a hard landing in China, but it does mean the problems for Beijing get bigger and bigger and they have to figure out other ways to dismantle those problems.” . Others however pointed to the strength of imports into China, saying that was a good indicator for the health of the domestic economy, though one element of that was companies stocking up ahead of this week’s Chinese New Year celebrations. The stronger-than-expected exports indicated signs of a recovery beyond China’s borders in the giant economies of the United States and the European Union. The stronger growth does also raise red flags about inflationary pressures building though consumer-price gains did slow in January from a year earlier. January’s consumer inflation fell to 2.0 percent from December’s seven-month high of 2.5 percent, suggesting price pressures are subdued for now. Economists expect inflation to gather steam through the first quarter, though likely staying below 3.5 percent in 2013, a level they think the government will soon announce as its target.
