# ORIG TITLE    Dakar rally: Despres storms back into contention . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Defending champion Cyril Despres held his nerve to regain the overall lead after the tenth stage of the Dakar Rally from Cordoba to la Rioja in Argentina on Tuesday. The Frenchman, who’s looking for a fourth Dakar title, finished 1 minute and 15 seconds behind Spain’s Joan Barreda who produced yet another flawless run to take his fourth stage win. This result sees the Husqvarna rider move up to 18th place while Despres now leads teammate Ruban Faria by one minute and 37 seconds. In the car category, Argentina’s Orlando Terranova took advantage of his perfect knowledge of the local dirt tracks to win his maiden stage. The 33 year old and his Portuguese co-driver Paulo Fiuza edged out Spain’s Nani Roma by just over two minutes while the races’s most successful driver and 2012 car champion Stephen Peterhansel of France increased his lead at the top of the general standings after finishing third.
