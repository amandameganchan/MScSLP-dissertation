# ORIG CONTENT  China has hit back at the United States over claims it is behind a series of hacking attacks on high profile American websites. In a televised statement, the Foreign Ministry rejected allegations that a secretive Chinese military unit is engaged in cyber-theft at the highest levels.. Hong Lei, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said: “To make speculations and groundless accusations for various purposes is unprofessional and irresponsible, and does not help to solve the problem. China is also a victim of cyber attacks. To our knowledge, the US was the main source of the cyber attacks China suffered.” . The diplomatic spat erupted after a US computer security firm, Mandiant, identified the People’s Liberation Army’s Shanghai-based Unit 61398 as the most likely driving force behind the hacking. Apple, Facebook and the New York Times are among the recently revealed victims of online spying with other targets identified in Canada and Britain.
