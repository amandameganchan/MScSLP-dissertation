# ORIG TITLE    Swiss scientists bend Caustic Effect to their will . 
# ORIG CONTENT  At first glance it doesn’t sound very exciting but a sheet of plexiglass is making waves at Lausanne’s Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale in Switzerland. When a beam of light is projected through it, an image miraculously appears – in this case a picture of British computer science pioneer Alan Turing. Scientists have developed a complicated mathematical formula to use the so-called Caustic Effect – the way light is refracted through water – to create images.
