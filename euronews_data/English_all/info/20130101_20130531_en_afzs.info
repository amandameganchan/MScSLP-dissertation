# ORIG TITLE    Prime suspect in Turkey car bombing detained . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Turkish police have the man they believe to be the prime suspect in the double car bombing which killed more than 50 people near the Syrian border in custody. A government official said that the two vehicles used in the attack were registered in the man’s name which has yet to be released, and that he had driven one of them to the blast sites. Police are still searching for two more suspects who were trying to cross the border to Syria. The government has accused Damascus of being linked with the incident in Reyhanli, promoting fears of the conflict being exported to neighbouring countries. In Istanbul, protesters are decrying the government as being to blame for the explosions. Turkey’s president Abdullah Gul has criticised the response of world powers to the Syrian conflict as mere “rhetoric” and called for help with the growing influx of Syrian refugees.
