# ORIG CONTENT  A Moroccan family of five have been killed in a light plane crash in south-eastern France. The couple and their three young children, a girl and two boys, were the only people on board. The adults were flying the twin-engine aircraft themselves. Farid Berrada, who was 46, was the head of a large painting firm in Morocco. The alarm was raised by a man who saw the plane crash into a hillside. “I heard a noise coming from the plane, it was as if the plane’s engine wasn’t working properly, and then there was a big bang,” said a witness. The plane crashed shortly after take-off from Grenoble airport early yesterday afternoon. It came down near Saint-Pierre-de-Bressieux. The cause isn’t known and no theory has been put forward. Last November six people died when an Algerian military transport plane crashed in the same region.
