# ORIG CONTENT  A police investigation has been launched into the gang-rape of a Swiss tourist in India. Seven men were said to have been involved in the attack which took place after the Swiss couple set up camp near a village in Madhya Pradesh. The victim was admitted to hospital, where she was later discharged. So far no arrests have been made. The couple were cycling to Agra when they set up camp near a village. The incident has again raised fears for women’s safety. Mamata Sharma Chairwoman of India’s National Commission for Women wants to see change in how rape cases are treated. “The accused should be punished and we should see that what kind of image of India we are presenting to the outside world. The government should take a strict action,” she said. The attack comes just three months after the deadly gang rape of an Indian student last December. It led to mass protests to call for change in the country where officials calculate that one woman is raped every twenty minutes.
