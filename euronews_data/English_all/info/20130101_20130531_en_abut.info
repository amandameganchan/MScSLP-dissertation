# ORIG TITLE    Third strike for Ryanair’s Aer Lingus hopes . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Ryanair’s says it has been told its bid to take over smaller Irish rival Aer Lingus is to be blocked by Europe’s anti-monopoly watchdog. This was Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O’Leary’s third – and he said final – attempt to buy Ireland’s former flag carrier. The low-cost airline denounced it as “not based on competition law” but a “political” decision “to meet the narrow, vested interests of the Irish government” – which owns a quarter of Aer Lingus’ shares. The European Commission said no final decision has yet been taken. Following a meeting with Commission representatives, Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely said: “It appears clear from this morning’s meeting that no matter what remedies Ryanair offered we were not going to get a fair hearing and were going to be prohibited regardless of competition rules.” . Aer Lingus said it had not been informed of any decision, but said it had always expected a rejection. “It was and remains Aer Lingus’s position that the offer should never have been made,” it said in a statement.
