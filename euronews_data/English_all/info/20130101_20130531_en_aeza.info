# ORIG CONTENT  The US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel has said it is likely that chemical weapons have been used by the Syrian government on a small scale. Visiting the United Arab Emirates, he said US intelligence had what he called “varying degrees of confidence” that sarin had been used against rebels. “We need all the facts; we need all the information. What I have just given you is what our intelligence community has said they know. As I have also said, they are still assessing and they are still looking at what happened, who is responsible, and the other specifics that we will need,” Hagel told reporters. The White House has said the use of chemical weapons would mean a “red line” had been crossed, leading to possible intervention. Nevertheless, it has written to congressmen, saying more proof is needed for there to be a change of policy.
