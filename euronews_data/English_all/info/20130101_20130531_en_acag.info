Reeva Steenkamp recently finished filming ‘Tropika Island of Treasure’ in Jamaica. The production company have decided to show the programme on South African television with an on-screen dedication. Meanwhile, lawyers and family members have visited a locked up Pistorious. “Our entire family is devastated. We are in a state of total shock, firstly about the tragic death of Reeva… After consulting with our legal representatives, we deeply regret the allegation of premeditated murder. We have no doubt, here, there is no substance to the allegation,” his uncle Arnold Pistorious told reporters. On Thursday, Pistorious appeared in court and was charged with murder. The double amputee cried as the charges were read out. He was not asked to enter a plea. Pistorious will be behind bars until a hearing on Tuesday.
