# ORIG TITLE    Alonso roars to triumph in China . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Spain’s Fernando Alonso held his nerve to claim the Formula One Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai on Sunday. In a strategic race dictated by tyre choice, the Ferrari driver took the lead from Britain’s Lewis Hamilton who had led from pole at the start of lap five. It was Alonso’s first win of the season making amends for crashing out of the previous race in Malaysia. Lotus’ Kimi Railkkonen was just over 10 seconds behind in second. Lewis Hamilton who had to fend off a late challenge by Red Bull’s triple champion Sebastian Vettel was third. Vettel’s lead over Raikkonen is now cut to three points, with Alonso up to third, a further six behind. Lewis Hamilton is a further three points adrift of Alonso and 10 ahead of Ferrari’s Felipe Massa.
