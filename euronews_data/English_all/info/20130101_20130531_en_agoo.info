# ORIG TITLE    Chronic job crisis worsens in France . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The number of people registered as out of work in France rose to a new high in April. Job centres opened their doors to an additional 40,000 French men and women. The total is up by 12.5 percent from April 2012. It has increased every month for the last two years, and at 3,264,400 is the worst since current records began in 1996. Youth unemployment also rose. As did the number of those who have been jobless for more than one year. The new record is a blow to President Francois Hollande, who is sticking to a pledge to reverse the unemployment trend by the end of the year. Economists say his government is unlikely to be able to achieve that with France having fallen back into recession in the first three months of 2013 and industrial layoffs mounting.
