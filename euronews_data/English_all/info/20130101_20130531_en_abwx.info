# ORIG TITLE    Erdogan: Turkey-Syria bomb was meant to provoke Ankara . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan says Monday’s deadly bomb attack at the Turkish-Syrian border was meant to provoke the Ankara government. Fourteen people were killed and dozens more were injured when a Syrian mini-bus exploded at the checkpoint near the Turkish town of Reyhanli. Erdogan hinted that his government may retaliate against whoever carried out the attack. “If this happens within our borders, it is to get Turkey involved. We are not intimidated but we want to be sure that we get full clarification. Then we will take all the required steps but this won’t go unpunished,” he said. Earlier, the Syrian National Council opposition group claimed intended target was a delegation of its leaders who were expected to pass through the border around the same time. Meanwhile UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has once again warned about the dangers of the Syrian conflict spreading to neighbouring countries. In a statement, Ban renewed his call for “all parties to refrain from using violence, exercise restraint and move toward a political solution”. Local media said more than 60 people have been interviewed in connection with the blast and one person is still in police custody. The border post near Reyhanli is one of the main crossing points for Syrian refugees into Turkey.
