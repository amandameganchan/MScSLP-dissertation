# ORIG TITLE    ‘Twilight’ bids to be year’s top turkey . 
# ORIG CONTENT  ‘The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn — Part II’ has topped this year’s worst-in-cinema dishonours, the ‘Razzies’, with 11 nominations, including worst acting awards for all its lead stars. Next in line of awfulness was yet-another Adam Sandler comedy ‘That’s My Boy’, with eight nominations. Although the ‘Twilight’ finale had better reviews than the franchise’s four previous movies, you would never know it from the Razzie nominations, which singled it out as Hollywood’s worst of the year. “The most-nominated film this year actually was a box-office hit. It’s the last of the ‘Twilight’ franchise, ‘The Twilight Saga: Breaking Down – Part II,’ which we refer to as ‘Twilight: S.B.D. #2.’ It’s our last chance to razz this series. Almost every entry has been nominated. It’s won almost nothing. We’re saying it’s the Razzie equivalent of ‘Lord of the Rings’,” laughed Razzies founder John Wilson. Tyler Perry has pulled off the rare feat of four individual nominations; worst actress in ‘Madea’, worst actor for ‘Alex Cross’, worst screen couple for himself and his drag partner, and worst director. Other worst-picture contenders are actioner ‘Battleship’, kid flick ‘Oogieloves in Big Ball Adventure’, and another Eddie Murphy misfire, ‘A Thousand Words’. Stewart and Perry face stiff competition for the worst-actress trophy; it includes Katherine Heigl for ‘One for the Money’ and Barbra Streisand for ‘The Guilt Trip’, but that may be more of a carrot; the organisers would love Babs to turn up with her star power and crack some jokes. “The Razzies are, basically, the opposite of almost every award show that there is. We’re at the scale where you’re going plbbbbbbb! And it is supposed to be funny. The people we nominate probably don’t agree. But there are some very famous names up for Razzie awards this year,” insists Wilson. Razzies favourite Milla Jovovich is again in the running for ‘Resident Evil: Retribution’, and she seems delighted. We will discover the winner, (or losers, depending on one’s perspective), on the eve of the Academy Awards, on February 23.
