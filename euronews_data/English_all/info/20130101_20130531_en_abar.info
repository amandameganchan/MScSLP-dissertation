# ORIG CONTENT  Officials from South Korea have called on North Korea to refrain from “provocations”. This came shortly after Pyongyang said it will go ahead with a nuclear test, in defiance of UN punishment. Recently North Korea has dramatically stepped up its threats against what it called its “sworn enemy,” the United states. Cho Tai-young of the South Korean Foreign Ministry said: “North Korea should listen to the messages the international community has sent until now, follow them and move forward in a non-confrontational manner. This path will benefit both North Korea and the international community.” . The North’s national defence commission rejected Tuesday’s UN Security Council resolution condemning a rocket launch in December. It reaffirmed that this was a peaceful bid to send a satellite into space, but said the country’s rocket launches also have a military purpose: to strike back at the United States.
