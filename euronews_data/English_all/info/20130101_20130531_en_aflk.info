# ORIG TITLE    Kenyan court gives two Iranians life sentences for attack plots . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Two Iranians have received life sentences in Kenya after being found guilty of plotting attacks against Western interests. They were arrested in Nairobi last year and led police to a stash of RDX explosives being hidden on a Mombasa golf course. An accomplice who supplied them with the explosives is still at large. Kenyan officials said the two men may have been planning attacks on American, British, Israeli or Saudi Arabian targets. “It is wrong, it is illegal, the magistrate has totally misconceived the law, we are going to appeal,” said defence lawyer David Karimi. Iranians have been suspects in attacks or plots in several other countries , notably Azerbaijan, Thailand and India in recent years, most with connections to Israeli targets.
