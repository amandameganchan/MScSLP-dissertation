# ORIG CONTENT  There was joy and celebration at last in Boston as runners were able to complete the marathon abandoned after the bombings last month. Athletes joined victims of the explosions to run and walk the last mile – or 1.6 kilometres. Called “OneRun”, it was held to honour victims and emergency workers and allowed three thousand people to finish the race they had started five weeks ago. “Just unbelievable. All the love. Even you guys here with the cameras, I just want to hug and kiss you all. I can’t believe what’s going on here. Whoa! Way bigger turnout than I expected,” said one man, a friend of a bombing victim. Tributes were paid to the three people killed by the bombs, and the policeman who died in a shootout with the two brothers thought responsible. US media have reported that suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev’s anticipated first court appearance has been delayed for another two months.
