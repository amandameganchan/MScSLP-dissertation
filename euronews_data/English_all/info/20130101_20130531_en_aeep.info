# ORIG TITLE    Montenegro Presidential Election . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Polls have opened in Montenegro for the countryâ€™s presidential election. Current President Filip Vujanovic is hoping to win his third term in office. Former diplomat Miodrag Lekic is his main opponent. Vujanovic forms part of the Democratic Party of Socialists, which has led the government for over 20 years and led the republic through its break from its state union with Serbia in 2006. The DPS won parliamentary elections held in October despite an economic slowdown and corruption. Vujanovic has topped opinion polls before the election. The Adriatic republic began European Union accession talks last year, which puts it next in line after Croatia of the former Yugoslav states to join the 27 member bloc. The country has been asked to crack down on organised crime. Montenegrans are split along party lines, however hope the new president will improve conditions in the country. Results from the poll are expected tonight.
