# ORIG CONTENT  China has sent a flotilla to the disputed waters of the East China Sea islands. The move comes in response to a group of 80 Japanese nationalists who entered the waters and claim to be surveying fishing waters. The Chinese presence is said to be the largest since Tokyo nationalised part of the island chain in September 2012: . This is the latest provocation in the territorial tensions over the islands claimed as Senkaku by Japan and Dianoyu by China. As tensions escalate, Japanese MPs visited the Yasukuni shrine to pay their respects to war dead. The move has been criticised as the shrine also honours 14 leaders convicted of war crimes. The hommage has angered Japan’s neighbours who deem it a glorification of their war atrocities. In response, South Korea’s Foreign Minister has cancelled a trip to Japan.
