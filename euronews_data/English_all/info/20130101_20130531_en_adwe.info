# ORIG CONTENT  Five children have been killed in a house fire in northern France. The blaze broke out on Saturday night in Saint-Quentin, around 130 kilometres northeast of Paris. The children’s father, who escaped with serious burns, called on a neighbour to help rescue them but it was too late. “When we managed to get into the house we couldn’t reach the first floor. We couldn’t do anything. We had to get out of the house,” said the neighbour. “Save my children, save my children, that’s all he said to me.” . The father is understood to have recently separated from his wife. He was looking after the children – aged between two and 10 – over the Easter weekend. The cause of the fire is being investigated, but officials believe it was an accident.
