# ORIG TITLE    Austria: Asylum seekers take protest to church . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Around 40 asylum seekers have camped out at a church in the Austrian capital Vienna, as part of a protest over their treatment. They say accommodation they are being given is poor. They are also calling for access to the jobs market. More than a dozen of those bedding down at the Votivkirche church are said to be on hunger strike. “As the government did not give us a good answer, we continue the hunger strike,” said one demonstrator. “If anybody dies, the responsibility is for the government,” he continued. The asylum seekers reportedly fled to the church from a camp in a nearby park, which was later raided by police.
