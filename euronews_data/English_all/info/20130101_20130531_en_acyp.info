# ORIG TITLE    U.N. Commissioner for Refugees concerned for fleeing Syrians . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Antonio Guterres, is in Ankara for a four day visit to Turkey. His aim is to deal with the plight of those displaced because of the ongoing war in Syria. He believes that the number of refugees outside the country could triple by the end of the year from the 1 million registered if there is no solution to the conflict. Most refugees have fled to Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Iraq and Egypt. Others have gone further afield to Europe and North Africa. Turkey has asked for internationally protected zones to be set up within Syria to protect fleeing citizens. Guterres said the United Nations was not against the measure but added that they should not undermine the right for refugees to seek asylum abroad.
