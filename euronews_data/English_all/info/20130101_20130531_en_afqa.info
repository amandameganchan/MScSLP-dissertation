# ORIG TITLE    US and Japan hold joint conference on cyber security . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The US and Japan are holding their first ever bilateral talks on cyber security in an effort to prevent malicious and intentional attacks. Governments see these activities, which include hacking and the use of viruses, as a growing threat to national security – especially as attacks become more sophisticated. The ‘Cyber Dialogue’ conference is being held in Tokyo. The two-nation conference comes in the wake of a report by the US Pentagon accusing China of cyber-spying against the American government. Beijing denies the allegations, saying it’s impossible to tell where the attacks come from.
