# ORIG TITLE    Sotheby’s sale proves there is life in fine art yet . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A portrait of his muse and mistress by Pablo Picasso has sold for the equivalent of 33 million euros at auction in London. The 1932 work came ahead of a sale of impressionist, modern and surrealist art, predominantly featuring works by Austrian artist Egon Schiele. Overall, the auction brought in just over 139 million euros – the second highest total of a sale of its kind in London, say Sotheby’s, and proof, if it were needed, that the world of fine art has not been too adversely affected by the global economic crisis.
