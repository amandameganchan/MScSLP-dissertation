# ORIG TITLE    Vonn wins Cortina d’Ampezzo . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Lindsey Vonn is back on form after her self-imposed Christmas break. She may have struggled a bit on her return last week in St Anton, but the American dominated the Cortina d’Ampezzo for a third time on Saturday. She had already won at the Italian resort in 2008 and 2010. The 28-year-old claimed her 58th career world cup win in a time of one minute 38.25 seconds. This victory adds to to her comfortable lead in the downhill world cup, a title she has won for the last five seasons. The overall world cup leader Tina Maze finished second 0.43 seconds adrift. The Slovenian now has a seemingly unbridgeable 670 point lead over Germany’s Maria Hoefl-Riesch who failed to complete the course. Third place went to Vonn’s compatriot Leanne Smith who finished 0.89 seconds off the pace. Having two Americans on the podium will be a huge confidence booster for the team, as this is the last downhill competition before the Schladming world championships in two weeks’ time.
