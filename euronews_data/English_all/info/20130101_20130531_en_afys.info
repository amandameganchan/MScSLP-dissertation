# ORIG CONTENT  An Al Qaeda-linked militant cell has reportedly been planning suicide attacks on French and US embassies in Egypt. The claim comes after authorities detained three Egyptians who they said were connected to Al Qaeda and had been found in possession of ten kilograms of explosive materials. State news agency MENA said the suspects had escaped from prison during the uprising that swept Hosni Mubarak from power in 2011. Franceâ€™s military intervention in Mali was cited as the motive for the planned attack on the French embassy.
