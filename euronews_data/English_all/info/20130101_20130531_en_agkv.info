# ORIG TITLE    Baghdad car bombs kill more than 50 . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A wave of bomb attacks seemingly designed to attack the Shi’ite community has killed more than 50 people across Baghdad. All the bombs targeted busy markets, and were clearly designed to create the maximum panic and loss of civilian life. At least 11 explosions were reported; a pair of detonations just a few hundred metres apart killed at least 13 in Sadr City in the worst single incident. Tensions between the Shi’ite and Sunni communities are now at their worst since US troops left Iraq in December 2011.
