# ORIG TITLE    Egypt’s Mubarak to have retrial, supporters rejoice . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The Egyptian courts have accepted former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak’s appeal over his life sentence and ordered a retrial. He was ousted from power following a revolution in Egypt in 2011. Mubarak and his former Interior Minister were jailed over the deaths of anti-government protesters. Judge Ahmed Ali Abdel Rahman said: . “The court has ruled to accept the appeal filed by defendants Hosni Mubarak and Habib Ibrahim el Adli and orders a retrial.” . There was a rapturous response from supporters, with one saying: . “This is a fair and correct verdict and thank God for that. Viva justice and congratulations to Mubarak.” . The retrial will be conducted by a different panel of judges, but will be based on the same evidence used in the previous trial. But the 84-year-old’s ailing health may be taken into account, according one of his lawyers.
