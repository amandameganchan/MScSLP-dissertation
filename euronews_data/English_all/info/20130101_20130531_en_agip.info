# ORIG CONTENT  French singer-songwriter Georges Moustaki has died at the age of 79. Born in Greece, he was brought up in Egypt before arriving in France in 1951 . He started as a songwriter in the late 1950s for Edith Piaf. During their collaboration he penned ‘Milord’, which tells the story of a lower class girl who falls for an upper class Englishman. Another of his popular compositions was ‘La Metanque’. A song about a somewhat etheral foreigner, it’s been translated into 12 languages. During the 1960s he began to carve out a career as a solo artist, and subsequently spent 40 years at the top. Moustaki gave up performing in 2009, revealing he was suffering from an incurable bronchial illness. He will be remembered as a humanist, and a lover of life perfectly encapsulated in his song ‘Ma Liberté’.
