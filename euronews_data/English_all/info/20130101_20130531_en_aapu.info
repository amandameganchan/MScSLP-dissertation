# ORIG TITLE    Many dead in Egypt military train crash . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A military train carrying young recruits to an army camp has derailed in a suburb of Cairo. At least 19 people have been killed and more than a hundred injured. Sources say the train was on its way into the Egyptian capital when it came off the tracks. Egyptâ€™s roads and railways have a poor safety record. People have long complained that successive governments have failed to enforce even basic safeguards. Last November, 50 people, most of them children, were killed when a train ploughed into a school bus at a crossing just south of Cairo.
