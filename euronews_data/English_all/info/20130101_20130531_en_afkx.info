# ORIG TITLE    EU unwraps new food labelling rules . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The European Commission wants to tighten food labelling rules in the wake of the recent horsemeat scandal. The issue came to light in January when it emerged that beef-labelled products contained traces of horsemeat. Under the proposal, all future testing of food will be mandatory and conducted without any prior warning. “The legislation that we are now proposing as Commission is that official controls should always be unannounced in order to strengthen our tools to fight fraud,” said Tonio Borg, the EU health commissioner. Random tests carried out in April found less than five percent of the more than 7,000 beef samples inspected contained horsemeat. The EU’s executive also suggests confiscating any profits from those who sell fraudulently labelled food. Its proposed legislation will have to be approved by MEPs and EU leaders before it can be implemented in each country of the European Union.
