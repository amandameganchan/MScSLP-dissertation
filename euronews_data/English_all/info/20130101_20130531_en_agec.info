# ORIG TITLE    Launch of Xbox ONE . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Gamers are looking forward to the launch of the new Xbox. It’ll be presented simultaneously in both London and Seattle. Microsoft has confirmed it’s to be called the Xbox ONE, and is claiming it’ll have a 500 GB hard drive and Blu Ray. It’ll have voice control and facial recognition. Skype capability is also included, perhaps not surprisingly, as Skype is owned by Microsoft. However it doesn’t appear to be tablet enabled.
