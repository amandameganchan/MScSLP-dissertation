# ORIG TITLE    Pakistan’s Musharraf avoids treason trial . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Pervez Musharraf has appeared before an anti-terrorism court over the murder of Pakistan’s former prime minister Benazir Bhutto. The former president was taken to the tribunal in Rawalpindi from his luxury residence in Islamabad where he’s currently under house arrest. Lawyers against Musharraf clashed with his supporters outside the court. It comes a day after the interim government decided it does not have a mandate to pursue high treason charges against Musharraf who is also accused of detaining judges illegally in 2007. But that decision could be reversed by whoever wins next month’s elections. Musharraf is facing various charges linked to his nine years in power. He’s said to have known in advance of the plans to kill Benazir Bhutto which he blamed on the Taliban. The former prime minister died in a gun and bomb attack while campaigning for re-election in 2007.
