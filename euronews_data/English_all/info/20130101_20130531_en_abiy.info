# ORIG CONTENT  Tyre maker Goodyear has confirmed its intention to close a plant in France which will mean job losses for almost 1,200 people. Near the northern city of Amiens, the management said this was its last option, after five years of fruitless negotiations. It said 2011 saw losses totalling more than 60 million euros. Unions recently called for intervention by President François Hollande, who voiced support for French workers at the Goodyear Dunlop division during last year’s election campaign.
