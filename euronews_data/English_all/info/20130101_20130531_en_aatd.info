# ORIG TITLE    Frescos discovered in Rome . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Romeâ€™s Colosseum has revealed more of its hidden treasures following a deep clean of a passage closed off for decades. Under traffic grime and limescale cleaners found vivid frescoes with vibrant colours, nearly 2000 years old. The colosseum is undergoing its first major restoration in 73 years, and the discovery is a welcome surprise that will have pride of place in an expanded exhibit when it re-opens.
