# ORIG CONTENT  Danish director Thomas Vinterberg has won the “Prix Media” in Cannes. The prize is awarded to the film with the best box-office potential amongst all those submitted for funding from the 2013 media programme. It was presented by Androulla Vassilliou, the European Commissioner for Education, Culture, Multilingualism and Youth at the Cannes Festival. Vinterberg’s 1998 film “Festen” or “The Celebration” won a clutch of awards including the special jury prize at Cannes. His last film, “Jagten”, received 100 thousand euros from the MEDIA programme. It earned Mads Mikkelsen the best actor award at Cannes last year. For Thomas Vinterberg, financial and logistic support from the public is essential for Denmark’s independent movie makers. “Without MEDIA or the Danish Film Institute we could not survive as a nation with film-making as an art form. It would slowly become more and more provincial and more and more mediocre so the MEDIA prize and the MEDIA programmeis extremely important,” he told euronews. Our correspondent in Cannes, Wolfgang Spindler, said: “This MEDIA award is usually the beginning of an international career for a European movie. We can be sure that Thomas Vinterberg will come to Cannes with his next movie.” .
