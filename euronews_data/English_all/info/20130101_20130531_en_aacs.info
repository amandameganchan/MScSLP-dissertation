# ORIG CONTENT  Senior Pakistani militant leader Mullah Nazir has been killed in a U.S. drone strike. Intelligence sources say his deputy and eight others also died. His death comes weeks after he was wounded in a bomb attack believed to have been launched by Taliban rivals. It’s understood two missiles struck a house in Angoor Adda near the capital of Wana close to the Afghan border. The killings could raise tensions between Islamabad and Washington. Analysts point out Mullah Nazir had formed close ties with the government and opposed the Pakistani Taliban. It’s understood he favoured attacking U.S forces in Afghanistan rather than Pakistani soldiers. Drone attacks have killed many senior Taliban leaders. But the tactic has sparked protests. Opponents argue the strikes kill large numbers of civilians and foster support for militants. On Wednesday a judge rejected The New York Times bid to force the government to disclose more information about its tactic of targeted killing.
