# ORIG TITLE    Election costs Italy another downgrade . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Fitch cut Italy’s sovereign credit rating on Friday. It was reduced from A-minus to BBB-plus with a negative outlook. The rating agency said that was, in part, because of the political uncertainty following the country’s recent inconclusive elections. Fitch does not believe a stable new government can be formed in the next few weeks and the economy already in deep recession is unlikely to get necessary structural reforms.
