# ORIG TITLE    Videla’s death leaves unanswered questions over Argentina’s ‘disappeared’ . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The death of former Argentine military leader Jorge Rafael Videla has been greeted with mixed feelings of relief and anguish. He passed away in prison on Friday serving a life sentence for crimes against humanity committed during the 1976-83 military dictatorship. For human rights groups the hope of finding the 30,000 ‘disappeared’ died along with him. President of the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, Estela de Carlotto said, “We feel relieved but at the same time this weight because he didn’t speak or contribute to us knowing where those 30,000 people that we are looking for are or the whereabouts of the 400 grandchildren that the Grandmothers [of Plaza de Mayo] are still looking for.” . Last year Videla was also convicted of overseeing the theft of 400 babies allegedly taken from their parents whilst in detention centres. Over 100 have now been reunited with their biological families. The names of the 30,000 who disappeared during the period known as the ‘Dirty War’, spell out part of the legacy of the man who ruled over what many deem the darkest period of Argentina’s history.
