# ORIG CONTENT  Amid domestic scuffles over European policy, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande have set aside their differences to present a united front to revive the EU’s flagging economy. Though the pair may have got off to a rocky start after Hollande’s election last year, he set out their joint wish list, which includes a job opening for a full-time Eurogroup President at a press conference in Paris. “We want Europe to do more on unemployment particularly among the young. Also we want to speed up the creation of a banking union, and to be more effective in economic governance and to bring fiscal systems in line with one another and put policies of growth and competition into motion,” said Hollande. Asked by a journalist whether she felt forced to renege on her austerity policies as European countries begin to question them, Merkel responded: . “If you have a look at the programmes, which we see in Spain, Italy, Greece, Portugal, and Ireland you’ll notice that they don’t merely focus on budget consolidation. They are massive structural reforms, that profoundly change the countries; most of all in Greece, where it is all about the creation of a new tax-system, a new health-system and a completely new administration.” . The meeting came as France announced record unemployment figures. Merkel has given Hollande a Berlin rendez-vous to discuss youth unemployment in July. Euronews correspondent Gianni Maggi reports from outside the Elysee Palace: “The meeting has resulted in a Franco-German motion on economic growth and employment to be submitted to the European summit at the end of June.” . They will hope to convince the other European leaders that their vision of closer EU integration is the way to save the eurozone.
