# ORIG CONTENT  Tens of thousands of people have taken part in this year’s March of the Living – a memorial to mark Holocaust Remembrance Day. The rally to honour the estimated six million Jews who perished took place in the former Nazi death camp at Auschwitz in Poland. “This is our history. We have no future without the past,” said Yaki Saada, a visitor from Israel. Throughout Israel, people also stopped their daily activities to stand in silence and remember the Holocaust as a two-minute siren was sounded.
