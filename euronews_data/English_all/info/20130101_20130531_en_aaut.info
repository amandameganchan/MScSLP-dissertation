The number of hostages killed and injured is unknown, and there are dozens of people still unaccounted for. A freed Turkish man praised the Algerian forces saying, saying “they acted very fast”. Another released employee, British man Darren Matthews, says he fears for those being left behind: . “My heart goes out to the guys who are still there and hopefully everyone comes home safe, because at the end of the day it is only work, you know? No-one should have to go through that just for their job.” . The plant is jointly operated by Algeria’s state gas company, Norway’s Statoil and British Petroleum.
