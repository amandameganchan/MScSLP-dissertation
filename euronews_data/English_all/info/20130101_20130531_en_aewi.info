# ORIG TITLE    Cuba’s Ladies in White finally pick up EU rights prize . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Cuba’s Ladies in White movement on Tuesday picked up the European Parliament’s Sakarov Prize that they won in 2005. They had to wait eight years before they could receive the award in person in Brussels because the Cuban government rejected their previous requests for permission to leave the island. Dressed in white, they meet every Sunday to pray at the Santa Rita church in Havana. The movement started life as the “Black Spring” in May 2003. Back then, 75 people including poets, doctors, journalists and activists, were condemned to between 15 and 28 years in prison for allegedly threatening “the security of the State”. Some of them have been exiled, others have been released because of health issues, but their cases still remain legally active. The “Ladies in White” movement was a spontaneous political protest, but it also became a way for these women to support each other. Euronews’ Sara Blanco met one of the group’s co-founders, Berta Soler. Click on the link above to see the full interview.
