# ORIG TITLE    Violent street gangs agree truce in Honduras . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Two of the most feared and violent street gangs in Honduras, Mara Salvatrucha and Mara 18 Street, have agreed to a church brokered truce. Although no ceasefire has been signed it marks a first step towards ending the violence that has claimed tens of thousands of lives. Honduras has one of the highest murder rates in the world. A unidentified member of Mara 18 Street made the following statement: “We’re asking for forgiveness, we say that from our hearts. This is a dialogue as we’ve told you, Rome wasn’t built in a day. The good thing is that we’re here and this helps.” . Rival gang Mara Salvatrucha responded: “What we’re doing now is something positive so that society can realise that in reality we want a change. We don’t want more violence, we don’t want crime, we want an incentive to work regardless of being a gang member.” . Honduran President Porfirio Lobo welcomed the move, which follows a similar pact reached last year in El Salvador.
