# ORIG CONTENT  Uhuru Kenyatta has been sworn in as Kenya’s fourth president. Thousands attended the ceremony in Nairobi. The new president is the son of Kenya’s first post-colonial leader, Jomo Kenyatta, and he swore his oath of office on the bible used by his father. Kenyatta’s election victory was confirmed by Kenya’s Supreme Court following a challenge by his opponent Raila Odinga. His election poses a problem for Europe and the Unites States as Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto have been indicted by the International Criminal Court in The Hague. Both men are wanted in connection with the deaths of 1,200 people in the tribal-fueled violence that followed the disputed election of 2007. The poll in March was relatively trouble free helping to restore Kenya’s reputation as one of Africa’s more stable democracies.
