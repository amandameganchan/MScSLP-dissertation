# ORIG TITLE    Cannes hears it for the girls . 
# ORIG CONTENT  There was beauty in the ending of the Cannes Festival, especially of the feminine kind. Steven Spielberg’s jury has singled out one entrant, “La vie d’Adele” or “Blue is the warmest colour”. The film has attracted attention for its explicit lesbian sex scenes as well as the performances of its two main actresses. “It is a film about life”, said actress Adele Exarchopolous. “Abdel Kechiche decided to make a film about love and in love there is sex and he has decided to show it because he thinks it’s important. It is also about the discovery of desire.” . French star Berenice Bejo, known for silent film The Artist, clinched best actress for her role in “Le Passé” or “The Past.” . “After “The Artist” this role could not have been more perfect for me”, she told reporters. “Let’s just say it allowed me to go from a very relaxed and positive character to someone much more complicated, much harder, someone looking for love. I think for an actor there is nothing better.” . Euronews’ correspondent Fred Ponsard said this year’s array of awards took on a journey through time and space from America to Asia via Europe. Cannes is a reflection of the world – it is amusing, complex and multi-faceted.
