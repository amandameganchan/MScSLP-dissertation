# ORIG CONTENT  A Syrian group of political parties and independent activists has condemned Israeli air strikes, which hit the outskirts of Damascus. The attacks, which happened on Friday and Sunday, reportedly killed dozens of Syrian soldiers. The National Co-ordination Body for Democratic Change accused Tel Aviv of using Syria’s internal conflict to its own political ends. “This aggression is aggression against all Syrian people with all its forces. None of the parties have the right to employ this aggression for their benefit,” said the group’s Rajaa Al-Nasser. Israeli troops held exercises in the Golan Heights, as the country sought to play down the air strikes. Israel says the attacks were not aimed at influencing its neighbour’s war – but only at stopping Iranian missiles reaching Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
