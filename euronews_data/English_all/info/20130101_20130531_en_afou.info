# ORIG CONTENT  Police have been searching a house in the US state of Ohio which three women escaped from after vanishing around a decade ago. Pictures have also been released of brothers Ariel, Pedro and Onil Castro who have been arrested in connection with the case. Authorities are trying to work out how the women could have been held captive for so long in the city of Cleveland without anyone noticing. “The nightmare is over. These three young ladies have provided us with the ultimate definition of survival and perseverance,” said Steve Anthony, an FBI special agent. “The families of these three young ladies never gave up hope and neither did law enforcement. As you can imagine words can’t describe the emotions being felt by all. Yes, law enforcement professionals do cry,” he continued. Missing since she was 16, Amanda Berry embraced her sister during an emotional reunion. Gina deJesus and Michelle Knight are also now safe and well. Rescued with them on Monday was a six-year-old girl who police say was Berry’s daughter. While jubilant about their rescue, the community now wants answers. Neighbours said they had made more than one call to police about suspicious activity at the house.
