# ORIG TITLE    Bangladesh struggles to find survivors from factory collapse . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Bangladeshi rescue services in the capital Dhaka are continuing a desperate search for survivors after a building collapsed killing at least 175 people. It is thought as many as 800 others remain trapped in the rubble of the eight-storey complex that housed factories supplying Western high street retailers. With more than 3,000 workers inside when the building came down, the death toll seems certain to rise. City authorities have filed cases against the buildingâ€™s owner for faulty construction and causing unlawful death. There are reports that cracks had been found in the building the day before and that officials had ordered its closure. Police say it appears the factory owners ignored a warning not to allow their workers inside.
