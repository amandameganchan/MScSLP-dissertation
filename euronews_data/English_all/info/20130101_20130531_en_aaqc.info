# ORIG TITLE    British PM David Cameron gives MPs teaser on EU stance . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Two days before his long-awaited speech on the EU, Britain’s Prime Minister gave a little hint to MPs that he’s not in favour of the in/out referendum many euro-sceptics want, but that the UK will renegotiate the terms of its EU membership. Addressing the House of Commons, David Cameron British Prime Minister said: . “I think the most dangerous thing for this country would be to bury our head in the sand and pretend there isn’t a debate about Britain’s future in Europe. What Britain should be doing is getting in there, fighting for the changes that we want, so then we can ask for the consent of the British people to settle this issue once and for all.” . Though Cameron doesn’t want a simple in-or-out referendum, many Europeans see the UK stumbling towards one, a view the Irish PM – and current EU council president – Enda Kenny is wary of: . == . “Britan was a driver of the single market, is an important and fundamental element of the European Union. And in my view it would be catastrophic were Britain to opt to leave the European Union.” . Follow David Cameron’s speech live on Friday morning from Amsterdam, right here on euronews.
