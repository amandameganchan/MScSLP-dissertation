# ORIG TITLE    Anger as China parades Mekong killers on TV before execution . 
# ORIG CONTENT  China has executed four foreigners convicted of murdering 13 Chinese fishermen on the Mekong river in 2011. The men were paraded live on state TV before being taken from their cells to their deaths, prompting much anger on social media. Many people said it was an unnecessary display of vengeance. The moment of death, by lethal injection, was not shown. Chief suspect Naw Kham, extradited to China in May, was found guilty of the killings last year in the “Golden Triangle” region known for drug smuggling, where the borders of Laos, Myanmar and Thailand meet. The Chinese government said it was determined to combat cross-border crime.
