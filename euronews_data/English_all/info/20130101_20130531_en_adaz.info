# ORIG CONTENT  One hundred and fifty employees of the Bolshoi theatre in Moscow have signed a petition in support of dancer Pavel Dmitrichenko, who allegedly has confessed to being behind the acid attack on the balletâ€™s artistic director Sergei Filin. They say they believe he is incapable of such an act. They also question the confession and the way it was extracted, and openly wondered if there is not something else going on in what has been portrayed as a personal dispute in the faction-riven establishment. In the confession Dmitrichenko admitted he had wanted Filin beaten up, but said he was shocked when he heard that his face had been splashed with acid in the Jan. 17 attack.
