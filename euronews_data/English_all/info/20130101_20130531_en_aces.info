# ORIG TITLE    Pistorius bail hearing adjourns after robust arguments . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Alone, head bowed and sobbing at times South Africa’s Olympic hero Oscar Pistorius’s second day in court ended after a series of rigorous arguments between prosecution and defence. The detective leading the murder investigation alleged a witness heard “non-stop shouting” and that two containers of testosterone and needles were found in the paralympian’s bedroom. Pistorius’s defence argue that the shouts were too far from his home to be identified and that it was not testosterone but a herbal remedy found in his apartment. Outside the bail hearing in Pretoria a group of activists gathered to protest against violence towards women. In South Africa figures claim that on average, a woman is raped every four minutes and one is killed every eight hours by her partner or relative. “As women, are we supposed to sleep with guns under our pillows, in case we mistake our loved ones with a burglar and kill them? And perhaps men will come here and see how many tears must women shed before something is taken into notice?” asked Moshe Mathe of the Youth for Survival protest group. The family of Reeva Steenkamp held a private funeral for the dead model with a hundred mourners. It’s understood a public memorial service is planned. The bail hearing for Oscar Pistorius has been adjourned until Thursday.
