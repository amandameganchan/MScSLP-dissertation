# ORIG CONTENT  Laura Boldrini, from the leftist party Ecology and Freedom which is part of a coalition with the Democratic Party, has been elected President of the Chamber of Deputies in Italy. The 51-year-old former journalist and ex-spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for refugees was chosen by the Democratic Party leader Pier Luigi Bersani. Her election marks a step towards ending the political stalemate in Italy after inconclusive parliamentary elections on February 24-25. In Italy’s upper house, the Senate, neither the left or right have a clear majority to elect their candidate. They will vote later on the two-front runners from the last ballot. Only once the Senate has a leader can coalition talks convene to form the new government.
