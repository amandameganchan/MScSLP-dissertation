# ORIG CONTENT  Protesters in Rome staged a demonstration aimed at the new pope. His identity remains a mystery, his dress code does not. Ermine fur will edge his ceremonial robes and that brought activists to demonstrate outside the Holy Father’s tailors in Rome. “Animals also have a spirit,” they chanted upsetting the neighbours and catching the discreet tailors by surprise. “We are here wondering if the Vatican is going back to the middle ages rather than being in 2013.Because the new pope is going to wear also a cloak with fur. So we are going to pray and ask the new pope not to wear furs,” explained Walter Caporale who is President of the group Animalisti Italiani Onlus. For the Gammarelli tailors who will dress the new pontiff from head to toe his identity has not exercised their minds but his size. Their guidance has been practical rather than spiritual. Small, medium and large garments have been prepared as have shoes of every size.
