# ORIG TITLE    Jewish congress held in Hungary amid concerns over rise in anti-Semitism . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The World Jewish Congress (WJC) . will begin its four-yearly Plenary Assembly in Budapest today. The meeting – in which Jewish people gather from around the world to discuss issues important to them – is usually held in Jerusalem, but the group has moved it to Hungary to highlight concerns over the rise of far right movements and anti-Semitism in Europe. A case in point is the right wing Jobbik party which won 17 per cent of the vote in the last election and rallied outside the venue. The Party leader Gabor Vona addressed the large crowd which had gathered saying: “We are special here in Europe, but not because we are the most anti-Semitic nation, but because even if all of Europe is at their feet, even if all of Europe licks their feet, we won’t do it even then.” . Peter Feldmajer the Chairman of the Federation of Jewish Communities said: . “The strengthening of Jobbik is only a symptom in these matters, the bigger problem is that around half a million people support thefar-right and many people accept the  negative attitude to Jews.” . Hungary’s Conservative Prime Minister, Viktor Orban, who is due to address the WJC assembly’s opening session this evening, had tried to have the Jobbik rally banned, but he was overruled by a Budapest court.
