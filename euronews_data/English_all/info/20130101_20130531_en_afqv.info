# ORIG TITLE    Andrew “Bart” Simpson dies in America’s Cup training . 
# ORIG CONTENT  British yacht-racing champion Andrew Simpson has died in an accident on training day for the America’s Cup in San Francisco Bay. Thirty-six-year-old Simpson had been sailing on the Artemis, Sweden’s entry, when it capsized. He had been one of an 11-member crew on board the catamaran. All of his colleagues were rescued and transferred to a support boat but Simpson was apparently trapped under the vessel. Doctors afloat with the team tried unsuccessfully to revive the British sailor after he was freed from the wreckage. It is not yet clear what caused the boat to capsize in the first place. It is believed to be the second time a sailor has died during training for the race – in 1999, Martin Wizner of the Spanish Challenge was fatally injured after being struck on the head by a broken piece of equipment.
