# ORIG CONTENT  Celebrations for football team Paris Saint-Germain winning the league will not be allowed again says the city’s police chief, after the revelry descended into chaos and violence. According to Bernard Boucault, 33 people, including three police officers, were injured in the French capital on Monday night. Some 21 fans have been arrested for “questioning after throwing projectiles or causing damage.” . “It’s very sad and above all it’s a catastrophic image we’re showing today to people abroad. We really don’t need this today. We have so many difficulties and it’s not worth it to have this kind of behaviour which is harmful to the whole country,” said one Paris resident. It is the first time PSG have won the French Ligue 1 in 19 years. 15,000 supporters gathered near the Eiffel Tower for what should have been a joyous occasion. “Parisians had been waiting for this victory, but it is obvious that football is still sick. It’s the case for Paris Saint-Germain. It’s also the case for numerous other clubs,” said French Interior Minister Manuel Valls. “Let me remind you that we regularly forbid supporters at a certain number of stadiums,” Valls added. The team, including English midfielder David Beckham, were only able to stay in Trocadero plaza for two minutes before the violence erupted. A parade along the River Seine was cancelled. In total, 800 police officers battled with hardcore fans known as “ultras” for several hours, during which time shops, restaurants and cars near the Champs Elysees had their windows smashed.
