# ORIG TITLE    Syrian activists blame government for deadly rocket attack in Aleppo . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Syrian opposition activists claim the government is behind the death of at least 20 people after an attack on Aleppo, the country’s largest town. Film footage of the attack cannot be independently verified but similar pictures have also emerged from Damascus where rebel held areas have been under heavy bombardement. In response, forces fighting to topple President Bashar al Assad say they fired three mortar bombs at a presidential palace. No casualties have been reported but the attack highlights how rebels trying to overthrow the Syrian leader are now able to hit the symbols of power. Meanwhile, the flow of people fleeing the violence is continuing across the border into Jordan. There are reports of clashes on the Syrian side of the border – and at least two refugees required medical attention upon arrival in Jordan. Many others – including young children – were seen waiting to be transported by bus to the Zaatari refugee camp.
