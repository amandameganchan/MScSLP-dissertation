# ORIG TITLE    The bracelet that watches what you drink . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Tucked beneath his left trouser leg, George is sporting a new alcohol control anklet, designed to monitor his intake. The inconvenience, he observes, is minimal: . “The first few tests you feel some vibration when it tests but quickly, like putting a watch on, you forget its there. It doesn’t buzz when you drink. It goes every half an hour regardless.” . The anklet may not actually stem the flow of ale, but Allen Tuller – manufacturer of the contraption at Society Scramx – only has to log into his arranged software to determine George’s consumption. Sensors in the strap chart your alcohol levels through analysis of sweat and skin temperature, and it’s possible to detail real-time updates every 30 minutes, should you so wish. CLaire George is a toxicologist and she notes the potential of the product: . “So its well recognized technology and well researched, and certainly the information that we’ve seen in the trials that we’ve been involved with, is very good.” . Having already undergone various trial runs across the UK, the benefits are clear. One woman, who wished to remain anonymous for this piece, is indebted to the anklet after she wore it for three months in order to prove to the courts, who had threatened to take custody of her children, that she had put her alcoholism behind her. As binge-drinking continues to rise throughout Europe, who knows how many others might profit from such self-regulation.
