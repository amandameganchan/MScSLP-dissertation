# ORIG TITLE    Boston bomb suspect Tsarnaev ‘walking’ again, says mother . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The mother of the surviving Boston bombings suspect says he is walking again in a prison hospital, following his injuries sustained at the time of his arrest. Zubeidat Tsarnaeva said she spoke by phone to her son Dzhokhar last week for the first time since he was held. She again maintained that he and his brother Tamerlan, who was killed, were innocent. Speaking in Dagestan, she said: “I’m the first to believe that my child is completely innocent, and to know that your child is like a beast in a cage, isolated from the world, it’s impossible to restrain yourself or your emotions.” . The father of a Chechen man shot dead during FBI questioning over his links with the Boston bombing suspects has shown photos he says were taken of his son in the morgue. He added that he wanted those responsible to be put on trial. Officials initially said Ibragim Todashev had suddenly attacked the agents in his home in Florida. Speaking in Moscow, his father Abdulbaki Todashev described the claims as “absurd”. “They were tormenting the man for eight hours. There was no lawyer, no witnesses, nobody,” Abdulbaki Todashev said. “I want justice. These are not FBI agents but bandits.” . US media reports quoted officials as saying Ibragim Todashev was unarmed. A special FBI team has begun reviewing the case. The son was under investigation over a triple murder in Massachusetts in 2011. They believe Tamerlan Tsarnaev, an acquaintance of Ibragim Todashev from the same Boston gym, may also have been involved.
