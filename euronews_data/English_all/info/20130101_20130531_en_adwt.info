# ORIG TITLE    Fifty Shades of Grey – the musical . 
# ORIG CONTENT  If you have read the book and can not get enough of it, now get ready for the musical. The erotic best-seller Fifty Shades of Gray has been lifted from the page to the stage and turned into a comedy. The off-Broadway parody is being performed by the Virginia based improvisation troupe, The Pushers. The play does not apparently have the blessing of the book’s British author, E L James, but its producer believes she will be able to share the joke. “No, you know what, it’s a parody. So you sort of play it over the top,” says Tim Flaherty.   “You take something that would be graphic in the bokk and then you just make it comical in the show. And I think that takes all the creepiness out of it. And you know, makes it fun and everyone can be in on the joke,” he adds. The explicit erotic tale of a young woman’s relationship with a dashing entrepreneur is told through dance and familiar pop hits and the writers are sure their twisted version has something to please everyone. The trio behind the work are Bradford McMurran, Jeremiah Albers and Sean Devereux. “We didn’t write ‘War and Peace‘ here. But it certainly is a fun one without a doubt. And I love that our crowd  is like typically like women and middle aged women andit may help out my dating life,” joked McMurran. Given the erotic and explicit sexual nature of the book, prudish people may feel they have to stay away from the musical, but the actors say a relaxed attitude is all that’s required. “You’ve got to be pretty comfortable,” says actor Matthew Bagley. Sentiments shared by his co-star, Elizabeth Gardner: “But we’re all very good friends. We’re all very close,  so it’s been really fun, which I think that helps not make it, what could be awkward situations, not awkward.” . Cuff Me: The Fifty Shades of Grey Musical Parody opens in May 5, at New York’s Actors Temple.
