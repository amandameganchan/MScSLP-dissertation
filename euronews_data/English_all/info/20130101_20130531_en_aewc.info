# ORIG TITLE    Beppe Grillo denounces re-election of Italian president . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The leader of Italy’s ant-establishment 5-Star Movement, Beppe Grillo has denounced the re-election of President Giorgio Napolitano. Following Saturday’s broad right-left deal to give the 87-year-old another seven-year mandate, hundreds of Grillo supporters took to the streets in Rome to make their feeling known. Napolitano agreed to remain in office for an unprecedented second term after the country’s parliament failed to elect a replacement in five rounds of voting. With Italy still without a government two-months on after inconclusive elections, Napolitano is due to spell out his strategy to end the political stalemate in parliament later today.
