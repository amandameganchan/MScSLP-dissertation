Police fired warning shots and tear gas in an attempt to disperse hundreds of demonstrators. As least six people have been killed, including three police officers, in the latest spate of violence. Port Said has been a tinderbox since January; when 21 people were sentenced to death after a riot at a football match left 73 people dead.
