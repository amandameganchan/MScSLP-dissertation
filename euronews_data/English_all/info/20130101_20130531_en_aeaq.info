# ORIG TITLE    Boeing gets Dreamliner boost from BA . 
# ORIG CONTENT  British Airways’ parent company IAG has firmed up orders for 18 of Boeing’s 787 Dreamliners in a show of confidence in the aircraft. The 18 planes are on top of a previous British Airways order for 24 Dreamliners which will replace some of BA’s current fleet of Boeing 747-400s between 2017 and 2021. At the same time IAG said it was talking with Boeing about a possible order for Iberia of 747 jumbo jets. In a nightmare scenario for Boeing, the 787 Dreamliner has been grounded since January because of battery problems, but the planemaker has said it is confident it has fixed that and the jets will soon be flying again. Regulators worldwide banned flights of the 787 after lithium-ion batteries overheated in two of the aircraft in January. Boeing has booked orders for 42 Dreamliners so far this year, and currently has firm orders for 841 of the planes.
