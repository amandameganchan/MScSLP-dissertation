# ORIG CONTENT  More than 40 people were killed at a funeral in Iraq, when a suicide bomber dressed as a mourner detonated his explosives among the crowd in the middle of a Shi’ite mosque. It happened in the city of Tuz Khurmato. Survivors said the attacker wore his explosives under a suit to blend in. More than 75 people were wounded. It’s the fourth suicide attack in a week in Iraq. The Shi-ite prime minister Nuri al-Maliki has faced weeks of street protests by Sunnis demanding changes in two measures that they say unfairly target the Sunni community.
