# ORIG TITLE    The return of the Rijksmuseum . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Amsterdam’s Rijksmuseum is getting ready to open its doors again after the mother of all makeovers. After 10 years and 375 million euros, the 19th-century building has been revamped and each of its 8,000 artifacts can now be found in a different place. That is, with one notable exception: Rembrandt… . As the director of the Rijksmuseum, Wim Pijbes, explains; “The Rijksmuseum was designed by architect Pierre Cuypers in 1885. This is a neo-gothic building with a kind of catholic image. The Gallery of Honour is a kind of basilica that ends not with a Christian display, but a civilian display: Rembrandt’s Night Watch.” . Indeed, for while Vermeer, Hal and Steen are several Dutch masters to feature heavily, Rembrandt continues to reign supreme over all others, with one of his most beloved works – The Jewish Bride – a centrepiece of the 17th Century section. Collection Director at the Museum, Taco Dibbit, believes the new format is offers a more immersive experience for visitors: “In the old museum there was one room for paintings, a room for glass, a room for silver, and so on, while in the new museum, you take a walk through the period. The intention is to create a feeling of beauty in relation to Dutch art and a feeling for the time itself.” . Despite widespread excitement about the museum’s renovation – which includes a new Asian art pavilion and gardens – the Dutch Cyclists’ Union are one group set to veto the opening after they clashed with architects over a plan to block a cycle path running through the museum. It seems that however feted Rembrandt may be in his homeland, nothing beats the bicycle in Holland.
