# ORIG CONTENT  US President Barack Obama arrived in Jordan for talks with King Abdullah II, which are expected to focus on the conflict in Syria. Fighting there is causing a flood of refugees into neighbouring Jordan. Before leaving Israel, Obama visited Jewish memorial Yad Vashem with Israeli President Shimon Peres and Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu. His Middle East trip also included talks with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and a visit to Bethlehem – part of a Holy Land tour that critics are saying has been high on symbolism but low on action. One of the concrete steps made during Obama’s trip was a thawing of frosty relations between Israel and Turkey. In a telephone call with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Netanyahu apologised on behalf of Israel for “any errors that could have led to loss of life” during a flotilla raid in Gaza in 2010. Nine activists were killed during the incident.
