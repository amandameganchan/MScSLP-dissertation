# ORIG TITLE    Mia Farrow demands aid for Syria refugees . 
# ORIG CONTENT  In her role as a United Nations goodwill ambassador, Hollywood actress Mia Farrow has appealed for more help for Syrian refugees. At the end of a two-day visit to camps in neighbouring Lebanon, she described the living conditions as “dire” after winter storms battered the region. “There are expecting more snow, more rain next week; so what are people do to? So it is truly an emergency and I hope the world will support,” said the actress. Farrow, who works with the UN children’s agency UNICEF, told reporters that 75 percent of refugees were women and children. She called on the international community to do more to help them survive the winter. To date over 600,000 people have fled the violence in Syria for neighbouring countries including Lebanon which hosts about a third of them. The UN expects the numbers of refugees to increase as hundreds of thousands of others have displaced inside Syria by the 21-month conflict.
