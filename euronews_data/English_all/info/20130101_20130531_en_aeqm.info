# ORIG TITLE    Thatcher “one of us” in St Paul’s . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The funeral of Margaret Thatcher, Britain’s longest-serving prime minister, and the one and only woman to have held the job, has made her exit in full splendour, honoured by a send-off that was only one step down from a state funeral. Civilian pall-bearers first carried the casket from the chapel in Westminster Palace to the hearse. The body of the world-famous Iron Lady was then taken in polished ceremony to one of London’s foremost landmarks, where the farewell services of national heroes Nelson, Wellington and Churchill were conducted. Guests at St Paul’s Cathedral included eleven prime ministers among the 2,000 mourners paying their last respects at the foot of the Union flag. The coffin was driven to St Clement Danes for a short service. Eight members of the armed forces then took the coffin back out and onto a gun carriage, which was accompanied by honour guards from units which saw action in the Falklands War. The Royal Marines Portsmouth band played Beethoven, Mendelssohn and Chopin. The procession marched at 70 paces per minute from Westminster, which has been the seat of the government for almost a thousand years, to “The City” (London’s business district), which can be said to have benefited in no small part from Thatcher’s 1986 removal of many restrictions. Thatcher’s immediate successor, Conservative John Major, and Tony Blair, who ousted him as Prime Minister as the head of New Labour, were on neutral ground in St Paul’s, with today’s leader, the Tory, David Cameron. The Lord Mayor ushered in Her Majesty, the Mourning Sword held high. Queen Elizabeth II has not attended a former Prime Minister’s funeral since Sir Winston Churchill’s, in 1965. The Queen is around six months younger than Thatcher was when she died of a stroke ten days ago at the Ritz Hotel, aged 87. The coffin was carried in through the cathedral’s western entrance. Thatcher’s grandchildren Amanda and Michael walked in front of it. Music included British composers Elgar, Purcell and Vaughan Williams. Richard Chartres, the Bishop of London, helped put things into perspective: “After the storm of a life lived in the heat of political controversy, there is a great calm. The storm of conflicting opinions centres on the Mrs Thatcher who became a symbolic figure, even an -ism. But today, the remains of the real Margaret Hilda Thatcher are here at her funeral service. Lying here, she is one of us.” . A private cremation ceremony was held later.
