# ORIG TITLE    EU road deaths on the decline . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Road deaths across the EU decreased by 9 percent in 2012, according to new figures published by the European Commission. Last year saw the lowest number of people killed in road accidents in EU countries since records began. EU Commissioner for Transport Sim Kallas, says the numbers are still unacceptable: . “There is more work to be done. Seventy seven people still die everyday on European roads. The development in some countries has gone into reverse. Most worrying are countries like Lithuania and Romania” . Around 250 000 people are seriously injured annually in accidents as the EU continues to search for effective strategies to reduce the number of people hurt on the road. Emmanuel Johnson was involved in a motorbike accident 8 years ago. Since then he has been confined to a wheelchair. He regularly returns to hospital for physiotherapy. He told euronews that the help available to him is slowly diminishing: . “We do get some assistance, but that is being reduced more and more in fact.” . What has been found is that hard scientific research into road accidents pave the way for effective legislation, which in turn influences behaviour reducing the number of killed and maimed on Europe’s roads.
