# ORIG TITLE    Italy finally swears in new government . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Ending a two-month political stalemate, Italy’s new government was sworn in on Sunday with former prime minister Mario Monti formally handing over to incoming premier Enrico Letta. Both the lower house of parliament and senate are expected to vote on the new government in two separate sittings on Monday. Trying to form a coalition that will last, Letta, from the centre-left Democratic Party (PD) has chosen Angelino Alfano from ex-prime minister Silvio Berlusconi’s centre-right PDL party as his deputy prime minister. Monday will also see Letta setting out his programme in parliament. He has said tackling an economy that has contracted for six consecutive quarters is a top priority. Youth unemployment is at 40 per cent. In charge of racial integration is the PD’s Cecile Kyenge – Italy’s first-ever black minister.
