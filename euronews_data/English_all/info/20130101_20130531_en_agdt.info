# ORIG TITLE    Survivors tell of the moment the Oklahoma tornado struck . 
# ORIG CONTENT  In the hours after the tornado struck, survivors began to describe what had happened to them – among them some of the children at the Plaza Towers Elementary school which had taken a direct hit. “The tornado went in and I was so afraid that I was hanging onto one of the desks and I fell back and then all the dirt start getting on my eyes and on my clothe,” said Isabela Rojas. Gabriel Ryan Wheeler added: “Well, it just, it was just thump, thump and the roof came off and then I felt something and then it was raining, clay on me and all that.” . More than 100 people have been pulled alive from the debris. Thunderstorms and lightening may have hampered the rescue effort but firefighters from more than a dozen fire departments and rescuers from neighbouring states are not giving up. Reporting for euronews Marci Gonzalez said: “First responders are out holding out hope that someone may have survived, they are looking through the rubble to see if anyone could still be trapped underneath.” .
