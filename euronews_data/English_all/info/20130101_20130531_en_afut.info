# ORIG TITLE    Turkey calls on world to act against Syria in wake of car bombs . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Ankara is accusing a group with links to Syrian intelligence of carrying out two car bombings in a Turkish border town, which left 46 people dead. The blasts, which ripped through a crowded shopping street in Reyhanli on Saturday, have stoked fears that Syria’s war is spilling over its borders. Damascus denies being involved. But Turkey says it is time for the world to take action against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. “As a result of our investigation, we found out that this Marxist terror organisation is directly related to the regime,” said Ahmet Davutoglu, Turkish Foreign Minister. “Turkey is calling on the international community to stop the aggressive attitude of the regime and to have a clear position against the provocative actions of the regime, which is spreading fire.” . Meanwhile, hundreds of protesters have been chanting ant-government slogans in the Turkish city of Antakya. Many in the region, a melting pot of sectarian, ethnic and religious groups, blame Turkey’s policy on Syria for the bloodshed spilling onto their soil.
