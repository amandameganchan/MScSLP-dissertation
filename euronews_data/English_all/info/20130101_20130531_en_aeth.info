Praising Obama, another woman said: “His heart is good towards the people of the nation and he shows up whenever there is a real need. And I feel there is a need right here today in Boston.” . “America as a whole is really lucky to have a president who, you know, months ago he came to Newtown, Conneticut to meet with the families who were greatly suffering, and he is doing the same for us,” added a third woman. During his speech at the service, Obama praised Boston’s resolve and said next year’s marathon would see “faster running” and “louder cheering”. The President also met families of the victims and emergency services staff.
