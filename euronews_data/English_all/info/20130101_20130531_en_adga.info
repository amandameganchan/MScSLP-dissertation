# ORIG TITLE    Vatican denies accusations of silence during dictatorship . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Only a few days in office and the Vatican has felt the need to issue a firm rebuttal of accusations against Pope Francis stemming from the time of Argentina’s so-called ‘Dirty War’. The former Archbishop of Buenos Aires has been accused of remaining silent during systematic human rights abuses by Argentina’s former military dictatorship. Speaking to a room full of journalists, Vatican spokesman Rev Federico Lombardi condemned the critics: . “There has never been a concrete and credible accusation towards him. The Argentine justice questioned him once as someone with knowledge of the facts, but never charged him with anything. He denied the accusations supported by proper documentation.” . Setting a moral tone in the early days of his papacy, Francis has told cardinals to stick to the faith’s Gospel roots. He’s expected to conduct his first Angelus audience where he addresses the crowds in St Peter’s Square on Sunday.
