# ORIG TITLE    Bean there, not done that in Jack the Giant Slayer . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Jack the Giant Slayer is a new take on an old tale. The film’s director, Bryan Singer, explained: “Well, the original story of Jack and the Beanstalk is very simple, very linear. A guy goes up a beanstalk, steals some stuff, cuts it down. I knew this had to be its own original thing, so I kind of imagined, what if the very simple story of Jack and the Beanstalk actually came from some big mythical thing that happened 700 or 800 years ago and what if I could tell that story? What if before that thing there was another legend that had preceded that? It became a story about the notion of story telling.” . British actor Nicholas Hoult, who plays Jack, says he was intrigued by the role: “I like reading characters that are unconventional and manage to change and transform throughout a story and for me, Jack really does that. He’s kind of been told that he’s fairly useless and always gets things wrong at the beginning of the story, but then he’s a have-a-go-hero and luckily for him things work out well along the way for this story.” . Newcomer Eleanor Tomlinson, who plays the princess, was happy to give her character some Alien roots : “I looked to people like Sigourney Weaver when I was looking for inspiration for Isabelle, because I wanted something strong. She’s not a damsel in distress, she’s not waiting in a tower for someone to rescue her, she’s a people’s princess and she wants to prove that, she wants to go out and have her own adventures.” .
