# ORIG TITLE    Give up luxury cars, Archbishop Tutu tells South Africa government ministers . 
# ORIG CONTENT  South Africa’s veteran Archbishop Desmond Tutu has called on government ministers to give up their luxury vehicles to prove they are serious about narrowing the gap between rich and poor. The 81-year-old said those in government should renounce their “opulent, ostentatious cars” to symbolise sharing the nation’s wealth. “People go to bed hungry in this land,“ he added. Speaking at a ceremony to mark his winning the Templeton Prize for promoting forgiveness and justice, he said the country had “the horrendous distinction of being the world’s most unequal society”. Tutu is due to be awarded the prize in London next month.
