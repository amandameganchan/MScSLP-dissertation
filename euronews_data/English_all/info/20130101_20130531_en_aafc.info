# ORIG TITLE    Rival Sudanese leaders agree to buffer zone, again . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The leaders of Sudan and South Sudan have again committed themselves to setting up a buffer zone along their disputed border. President al-Bashir of Sudan and Salva Kiir of South Sudan had originally agreed last September to withdraw their armies to allow oil exports to start up again. The move announced by the African Union came during a two-day summit in Ethiopia after months of unproductive talks. Each side accuses the other of supporting rebels on different sides of the border, accusations denied by both. Both economies badly need the oil to flow again from the fields in South Sudan, through Sudan, and onto world markets. The legacy of one of Africaâ€™s longest civil wars is deep distrust. Both sides stand accused of using the confrontation to shore up domestic support and divert attention from economic problems and corruption.
