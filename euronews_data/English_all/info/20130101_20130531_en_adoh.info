# ORIG CONTENT  A Pakistani Taliban member has threatened to kill former President Pervez Musharraf when he returns home from exile to contest elections. In a video obtained by Reuters news agency, Adnan Rasheed, warned the militant group is preparing to “send Musharraf to hell.” . Rasheed was among 400 prisoners who were broken out of a jail by militants in 2012. He had previously attempted to assassinate Musharraf who angered the Taliban and other groups by joining the US-led war against terrorism after the September 11 attacks. Militants were especially enraged when Musharraf’s security forces launched a full-scale attack on Islamabad’s sprawling Red Mosque in 2007 after followers of radical clerics running a Taliban-style movement from there refused to surrender. Musharraf is due back in Pakistan on Sunday after four years of self-imposed exile in Dubai and London. He plans to contest parliamentary elections in May but the former army general faces possible arrest on charges that he failed to provide adequate security for former prime minister Benazir Bhutto before her assassination in 2007.
