# ORIG TITLE    Thatcher’s legacy divides in life and death . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The death of Margaret Thatcher was cause to celebrate for thousands in Britain who recall her rule as the main reason for social unrest in the 1980s. Such feelings are particularly high in Brixton, the south London town where some feel her radical right-wing policies led to fierce rioting. “That woman made my youth a misery. I think that she was to blame for most of the ills in society and most of the things that poor people and old people have been blamed for were her fault,” said one demonstrator. It may be 23 years since she resigned but for many in Brixton, Margaret Thatcher will not be forgiven or forgotten.
