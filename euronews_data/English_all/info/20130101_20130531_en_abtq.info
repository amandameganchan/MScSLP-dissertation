# ORIG CONTENT  Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has said he will not negotiate his country’s disputed nuclear programme under pressure. He was speaking in Tehran during celebrations to mark the anniversary of the Islamic revolution. Analysts believe his tone was more conciliatory than Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khameni who earlier this month rejected a call for direct negotiations with the US. He has the final say on all key decisions. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told the crowds: “You pull away the gun from the face of the Iranian nation and I will talk to you in person. Dialogue should be based on justice and respect, not on pressure and imposition.” . It’s 34 years since the last Shah of Iran went into exile setting in motion events which established the Islamic Republic. Ayatollah Khomeini returned to Tehran to be greeted by several million Iranians. The royal reign finally collapsed on February 11, 1979. Since then tensions with the west have existed. Iran has agreed to meet world powers for talks in Kazakhstan at the end of this month.
