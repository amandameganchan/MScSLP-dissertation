# ORIG TITLE    Spain’s Princess Cristina to face court in corruption trial . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The King of Spain’s daughter has been summoned to appear in court over her alleged involvement in corruption for which her husband is standing trial. In the unprecedented case against a member of the royal family, the judge said there is evidence that Princess Cristina cooperated with her husband, Inaki Urdangarin, who is accused of embezzling around six million euros in public funds as well as tax fraud. Urdangarin, a former Olympic handball player is accused of massively overcharging local authorities when organising sporting events. He has been suspended from all official royal engagements since December. As many Spaniards face severe economic difficulties their relationship with the once popular royal family is turning sour. Along with the corruption scandal King Juan Carlos’s luxury lifestyle and allegations of adultery have attracted criticism.
