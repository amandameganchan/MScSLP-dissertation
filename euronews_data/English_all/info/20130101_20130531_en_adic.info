# ORIG TITLE    India-Italy row escalates after court ruling . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Italy’s envoy to India Daniele Mancini does not have legal immunity. That ruling has come from India’s Supreme Court on Monday in an escalating row between the two countries. It is the latest development in Rome’s refusal to return two marines charged with murdering two Indian fishermen. The men were allowed to got back to Italy last month to vote in the national elections and to celebrate Easter with a written promise from Ambassador Mancini that they would return to stand trial. The marines were part of a military security team aboard a cargo ship when they opened fire on a fishing boat. Airports were alerted and security tightened last week after India barred Daniele Mancini from leaving the country. The Italian embassy in Delhi has made no comment on the latest ruling. The Supreme Court said the ambassador had waived his immunity by giving an undertaking to a court that the marines would return.
