# ORIG CONTENT  Australia is bracing for days of “catastrophic” fire and heatwave conditions. Fires are already burning in five states and a search is continuing for around 100 people missing after devastating wildfires in Tasmania. Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard has visited the island and promised aid for those affected. Survivors in Tasmania have spoken of a “fireball” that engulfed communities across the state. In other states, emergency rescue services are combing through still-smouldering ruins of homes and vehicles while carrying out evacuation measures. A record heatwave, which began in Western Australia two weeks ago, was the fiercest in more than 80 years. Now with a fifth day of searing temperatures and strong winds, authorities say they’re expecting the worst fires in a decade.
