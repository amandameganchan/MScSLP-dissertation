# ORIG CONTENT  A late winter storm has dumped heavy snow bringing chaos to much of the US Midwest. There have been numerous highway crashes and flight cancellations as the storm moved east towards the Ohio Valley and the mid-Atlantic states. More than 1,000 flights have been cut in and out of Chicago’s O’Hare and Midway airports. More than 15 cm of snow fell at O’Hare, according to the Chicago Department of Aviation. Slick roads have contributed to numerous crashes and a slow commute across the border in Minnesota while driving conditions remained difficult along highways in parts of North Dakota. The weather service said the snowfall could be the heaviest in Washington for two years.
