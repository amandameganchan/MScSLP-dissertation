# ORIG CONTENT  Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika has been transferred to a hospital in Paris after suffering a minor stroke on Saturday. State media has said his condition is not serious. The 76-year-old, who is serving his third term as president, is seen as a key stabilising factor in the oil exporting country of 37 million people. Elected in 1999, Bouteflika is one of a generation of leaders who have ruled Africa’s biggest country since Algeria won independence from France in 1962. It is thought unlikely that he will seek a fourth term when his presidency ends in 2014. It is not yet clear who might take over the country which supplies a fifth of Europe’s gas imports and cooperates with the West in combating Islamist militancy.
