# ORIG TITLE    Second day of bombardment as Syria troops try to retake Raqqa . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Opposition activists claim 39 people have been killed as the Syrian city of Raqqa was bombarded for a second day. On Tuesday, rebels overran the northeastern provincial capital, reportedly seizing the governor Hassan Jalili. More troops have been sent to recapture Raqqa and activists claim Wednesday saw at least 25 air raids. However, none of this has been enough to stop the rebels sacking the governor’s mansion. One woman standing by a torn-down statue of the president’s father, former leader Hafez al-Assad, calls Bashar al-Assad a “dog” and said that the women of Syria are coming for him. As the fighting continues, The UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR) issued a warning over the plight of Syrian refugees, whose numbers are increasingly putting pressure on neighbouring countries. The number of people who have fled the violence is now over one million – ahead of the June date formally predicted by the UNHCR.
