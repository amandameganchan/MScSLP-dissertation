# ORIG TITLE    Taiwan rocked by 6.1 magnitude earthquake . 
# ORIG CONTENT  An earthquake measuring 6.1 on the Richter scale has struck Taiwan. There are reports of a 72-year-old woman being killed by a collapsed temple wall. At least 19 people were injured. The island experiences several minor earthquakes so evacuation procedures are well-practiced. Buildings are also constructed to withstand the tremors so damage was limited. The epicentre of the tremor is the predominantly rural Nantou, the countryâ€™s second largest province. The province is 250 kilometres south of the capital Taipei. Nantou is near the epicenter of a magnitude 7.6 earthquake that killed more than 2,300 people in 1999.
