# ORIG TITLE    Riot police storm sit-in by Greek subway workers . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Riot police in Athens have attempted to break up a nine-day strike by underground railway workers. Officers forced their way through a metal gate shortly after 4.00am on Friday morning. At least 10 people were detained and one person injured. Workers are protesting against planned wage cuts of around 25 percent. Some have now returned to work but many are continuing to strike despite facing arrest and up to five years in jail under emergency laws. One protestor said: “The government is using violence to try to force us to stop our strike and give up our demands.” . Other transport unions are holding walkouts in solidarity with the subway workers, leaving people in Athens with no public transport. The government has said it must implement the pay cuts to meet conditions for international rescue loans.
