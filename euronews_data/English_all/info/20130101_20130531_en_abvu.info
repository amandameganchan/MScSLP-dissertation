# ORIG CONTENT  North Korea has confirmed that it has successfully conducted a third nuclear test in defiance of international warnings. Pyongyang says it used a miniaturised device that had a greater explosive force than previous tests. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has condemned the test as “deplorable” and an emergency meeting of the Security Council is to be held later. In January North Korea announced it planned to conduct a “high-level” nuclear test, in response to expanded UN sanctions imposed after its last long-range missile test in 2012.
