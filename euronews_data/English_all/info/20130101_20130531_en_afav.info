# ORIG TITLE    Israeli PM Netanyahu forced to land in helicopter as drone heads for Israel . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The Israeli military says one of its fighter jets shot down a drone from Lebanon that was approaching its border on Thursday. They said an F-16 intercepted the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) 9km west of the port city of Haifa. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was flying in a military helicopter to a public event in the north of the country at the time and briefly had to land as the drone was being intercepted. It is not believed he was being deliberately targeted however, as his flight plans were not made public. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the alleged aerial infiltration but the Israeli navy is trying to salvage the wreckage from the Mediterranean sea to inspect it for clues. The last such incident was said to be carried out by Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed Lebanese guerrilla group, which sent a drone into southern Israel last October.
