# ORIG TITLE    Pakistan’s game-changing election . 
# ORIG CONTENT  There is uncertainty and excitement in Pakistan on the eve of landmark general elections on May 11 – but also fear. The vote could mark the first time an elected government completes a full term and hands over to a democratically-elected successor. Over the last three months, militants have killed at least 130 people in attacks on candidates and party workers. The Taliban has threatened to target the vote. A woman working at a polling station said, “Many female staff have already refused to work because of the threats and they’re scared. I trust in Allah.” . Tens of thousands of security personnel have been deployed to make sure people can vote safely. Former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of the Muslim League party had been widely tipped to take power again until a week ago. But after Imran Khan’s injury at an election rally this week, support for his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party has surged to almost 25 percent according to a poll on May 8. Khan’s popularity could also cause upset for the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP), which – along with the Muslim League and the military – has dominated the country’s political landscape for decades.
