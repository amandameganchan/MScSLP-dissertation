# ORIG TITLE    Few coins in the fountain as Italians seek answers . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Italy’s financial crisis means these days people are less likely to throw their coins into Rome’s Trevi Fountain. Many content themselves with simply posing instead. Popular legend has it that throwing a coin in the fountain guarantees you will one day return – but many are asking whether Italy is actually going anywhere in the first place. “It is a problematic result but it is the choice of the Italian people so we are just going to have to make it  work” said one man. “We are really in a bad way, on an international level and domestically. We can never do again what we have done today. We just can’t bring back Berlusconi.” mused another, while for a third, all is “Confusion, just confusion”. As well as frustration from the Italian people, analysts are warning of a potentially negative reaction from the markets.
