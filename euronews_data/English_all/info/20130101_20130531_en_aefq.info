# ORIG TITLE    Clashes outside Turkey Ergenekon trial . 
# ORIG CONTENT  At least three people have been injured as police clashed with supporters of 275 defendants in a four-year conspiracy trial in Turkey. Those on trial are accused of having ties to ultranationalist group Ergenekon, described as a “terrorist network” by Turkey’s governing AKP party. Supporters and relatives tried to break through police barriers outside the Silivri Prison Complex in Istanbul where 66 of those on trial are being held. The defendants were supposed to begin the final part of their defence, after prosecutors demanded life sentences for 64 of them. The trial has been postponed until April 11. Retired armed forces commander Ilker Basbug is one of those on trial, along with other military officers, politicians and academics. Basbug has been accused of ‘gang leadership’ and seeking to unseat the government by force. There have been increasing investigations into Ergenekon since 2007 and critics have accused Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s government of scaremongering to silence its opponents.
