# ORIG CONTENT  Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem is set to be named as the new head of the Eurogroup on Monday. He’ll take over from Luxembourg’s Jean-Claude Juncker to lead the powerful body of eurozone finance ministers. The role will grow in importance over the next years as the currency area adopts more integrated economic policymaking. “We don’t know that much about him, he is a relative newcomer on the European political scene, certainly he comes with a good pedigree, from the recent Dutch elections that produce pro-european government but beyond that,very little is known about him,” said Fabian Zuleeg, Chief Economist at the European Policy Centre. Dijsselbloem has been heavily backed by Germany to take over the position of Eurogroup president. But the candidate from the group of northern European countries backing tough economic reforms has received a cooler response elsewhere. France has so far remained silent as to whether it will support Dijsselbloem’s bid.
