# ORIG TITLE    Pope’s Swiss Guards sworn in with colourful flourish . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Part of a vibrant and popular Vatican tradition, the Pope Francis’ new Swiss Guards have been sworn in. The Guard is made up of 110 men who come to Rome from Switzerland to protect the pontiff. Recruits arrive at the Vatican three times a year and spend several months preparing for the swearing-in ceremony, which is held every year on May 6. The occasion commemorates the day in 1527 when 147 Swiss Guards died protecting Pope Clement VII during the Sack of Rome.
