# ORIG TITLE    CeBit dumbs down to draw in the crowds . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The world’s top computer and IT fair is underway in Hanover Germany – but this year the CeBIT, as it’s known decided to dumb down by being more consumer friendly and less of a playground paradise for the professionals. Despite the weak economic environment a total of around 4,000 exhibitors from 70 countries showed up all getting behind the main themes of Cloud computing, Big data and sharing in cyberspace. Reporting for euronews Anja benicze said: “This year’s motto ‘Shareconomy’ means the joint use and sharing of knowledge, contacts and resources. Actually a familiar concept, that seems to make new sense in view of the current financial crisis. But it was the gadgets which really pulled in the punters… with everything from a glove that can be used as a mobile phone to a remote-controlled spy helicopter. But if the trade fair is seen as a barometer of the economy, a lightweight Android who never seemed to tire could well be the worker of the future… .
