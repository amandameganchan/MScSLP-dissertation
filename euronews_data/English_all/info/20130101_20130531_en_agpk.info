# ORIG CONTENT  Under thick Siberian permafrost Russian scientists have uncovered the remains of a mammoth with perfectly preserved muscle tissue and blood. The scientists believe the female animal could have roamed the earth 10-15,000 years ago. The discovery in the New Siberian Islands, or Novosibirsk Islands has revived hopes of a ‘Jurassic Park’ dream of cloning long extinct species. While excavating the ice under her stomach, blood dripped out, to the astonishment of the researchers. “We have put the blood sample into the freezer of the Mammoth Museum. It still did not freeze at -17 degrees Celsius. We need to study it thoroughly before we jump to any conclusions,” noted Semyon Grigoriev, Director of the Mammoth Museum of the Russian North-Eastern Federal University. The scientists believe the blood could have possessed cryoprotective properties which would help the animal survive the bitter winters. Several attempts at cloning have been made since the 1990s from less fresh specimens. The discovery of liquid blood scientists say gives them a good chance of finally reviving the species.
