# ORIG TITLE    US snow storm could break records, warn forecasters . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Preparations are underway for what has been described as a “potentially historic” snowstorm which is set to hit the north eastern states in the US. Meteorologists have predicted around 60 centimetres of snow will fall in several areas with winds gusting to 100 kilometres per hour. Panic buying has been reported in some shops in preparation for the storm which is set to rage through Friday night. The city of New York where memories of October’s hurricane Sandy are still fresh has been put on alert. “It looks like everyone is aware the storm is coming. They’re stocking up with all the necessary supplies. Bread and milk seem to be the number one sellers right now,” said one shop manager. Before the first snowflakes had even fallen airlines cancelled hundreds of flights across the region with disruptions set to ripple across the US. Forecasters have said they believe the storm will be one for the record books.
