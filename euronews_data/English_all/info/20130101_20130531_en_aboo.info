# ORIG TITLE    Fed downplays hack attack . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The Federal Reserve has admitted that one of its internal websites was hacked, raising questions about cyber security at the US central bank. It stressed that none of its critical functions were affected. “The Federal Reserve system is aware that information was obtained by exploiting a temporary vulnerability in a website vendor product,” a Fed spokeswoman said. “Exposure was fixed shortly after discovery and is no longer an issue. This incident did not affect critical operations of the Federal Reserve system,” the spokeswoman said, adding that all individuals effected by the breach had been contacted. Members of the hacker activist group Anonymous are claimed to have accessed Fed computers last weekend, stealing personal information about more than 4,000 US bank executives, which were then posted on the internet. Reportedly that was taken from a Fed contact database for use during a natural disaster. Reuters reported that a message sent by the Fed to members of its Emergency Communication System warned that mailing address, business phone, mobile phone, business email, and fax numbers had been published. “Some registrants also included optional information consisting of home phone and personal email. Despite claims to the contrary, passwords were not compromised,” the Fed said. The website’s purpose is to allow bank executives to update the Fed if their operations have been flooded or otherwise damaged in a storm or other disaster. That helps the central bank to assess the overall impact of the event on the banking system.
