# ORIG TITLE    Ono, only Ono in Frankfurt . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Yoko Ono threw some voguish shapes for the photographers at the opening at the Schirn Kunsthalle in Frankfurt, Germany, which is presenting a retrospective selecting work from her 60-year artistic output. She is mainly known because of her relationship with John Lennon. But the exhibition shows that Lennon’s widow was already an artist in her own right before she met the famous band leader. “I’m going to be 80 years old and I can’t believe it. I mean I just don’t think that’s possible. Because I feel that I haven’t done enough. I mean enough for an 80- year-old person,” she said. Born to a wealthy family in Tokyo Ono started her career as an artist of the Fluxus movement in the 1950s. The strong-minded avant-garde artist had a varied output, including installations, texts, music and film projects and has always explored the crossover between art and language, music and philosophy. “My music education, which started around when I was three or four, I think most of the things that I’ve learned, for instance songs, German lieders and all the sort of exercises and skills, all come from Germany,” she added. Ono married John Lennon in 1969 and ever since her artistic activity has been overshadowed by her relationship with the Beatle, and was even widely claimed by the media to have created the break-up of the group. “The show exhibits the entire work of Yoko Ono, who is obviously one of the most prominent figures in cultural history of the 20th century, but on the other hand is an Avant-garde artist, whose work is extremely relevant for the next generation of artists and who developed work in the 60s and 70s that is without precedent and really explored the borders of conceptual and performative art.”, says gallery director Max Hollein. The exhibition travels on from Frankfurt, Germany to Norway, Austria and Spain. 80 years young, Ono still rocks, and shows no signs of slowing down just yet.
