# ORIG TITLE    Deadly violence in Egypt after court issues death sentences for football hooligans . 
# ORIG CONTENT  At least 22 people have been killed in clashes with police in Port Said in Egypt. The violence follows a decision by an Egyptian court to sentence 21 football fans to death for their part in riots last February which killed 74 people. Another 52 fans who have been charged will find out their fate in March. Egypt’s worst-ever football disaster happened after a game at Port Said stadium between local side al-Masry and Cairo’s al-Ahly. Al-Masry fans invaded the pitch, throwing stones and fireworks. Spectators were trampled to death as panicked crowds tried to flee the stadium. The judge’s ruling caused anger in Port Said, where the accused men come from. Supporters clashed with police outside the prison where the men are being held, leading to the deaths of at least 22 people. In Cairo, there were celebrations at the death sentences. Al-Ahly football fans and families of those killed had threatened more violence if the punishments did not satisfy them.
