# ORIG TITLE    Furious Friday sees strikes all over Europe . 
# ORIG CONTENT  It has been a day of industrial action all over Europe. In Belgium, hundreds of steel workers blocked border crossings to and from neighbouring countries, furious at plans by the steel giant ArcelorMittal to slash production threatening more than a thousand jobs. In France, PSA Peugeot-Citroen workers occupied the offices of a steel industry managers’ organisation as part of an ongoing protest against the planned closure of a car factory in Aulnay near Paris. The plant has been paralysed for eight weeks by a strike. Travellers using the airport serving Bonn and Cologne in Germany had delays and cancellations as security staff walked out. It’s part of a long running dispute over contract terms and pay. Dozens of flights were cancelled. Passengers using Berlin’s Tegel airport were also affected. There was disruption too at Madrid’s main international airport. About 2,000 workers protested against pay cuts and massive lay-offs at Spain’s national carrier Iberia. And tourists hoping for some ancient Greek culture found all public archaeological sites strike bound – including the Parthenon temple at the Acropolis. Workers are angry about a planned restructuring of the Culture Ministry.
