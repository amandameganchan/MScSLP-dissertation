# ORIG CONTENT  The German wrestling association reacted with shock on Thursday to the International Olympic Committee’s decision to drop the sport from the Olympic program. Speaking at the wrestling training centre of Aschaffenburg, sports director Jannis Zamanduris said changes needed to be made to make the sport more attractive, but maintained the IOC’s reaction was totally unexpected. Wrestling’s surprise exit has been blamed by some on a lack of political support within the IOC executive board, where other sports at risk – including modern pentathlon and taekwondo – had the upper hand with representatives in the 15-member group.
