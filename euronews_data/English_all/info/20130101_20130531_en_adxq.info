# ORIG TITLE    South Korea promises ‘strong response’ to threats from North . 
# ORIG CONTENT  South Korean President Park Geun-hye said on Monday there will be a strong and swift military response to any further North Korean provocation without regard to political consequences. This comes after Pyongyang said it was entering a “state of war” with the South two days earlier. It is angered by new UN sanctions which followed its February nuclear test, as well as the annual joint US-South Korea military drills which are currently under-way. The US has now sent F-22 stealth fighter jets to to bolster the military exercises. North Korea also threatened to close down the Kaesong Industrial Park, which serves as the last example of inter-Korean cooperation. Kim Duk-soo, a South Korean who works in Kaersong, said: . “I’m quite worried but what can I do? I have to go there to work. I don’t know what they’re thinking in the North but how could they close it? They need to make money and the industrial park is their cash cow.” . His compatriot Cho Young-man added: . “Even if the complex gets closed down I hope our workers will be able to come back without being detained.” . Despite the increasingly aggressive posturing it is thought the complex will remain open as it serves as an important source of hard cash for the impoverished North.
