# ORIG TITLE    Neureuther celebrates Wengen slalom win . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Felix Neureuther wrapped up the weekend’s world cup action at the Swiss resort of Wengen on Sunday by winning the men’s slalom race. The German was second after the first run but skied a near-perfect second leg down the Männlichen course to secure his fourth career world cup victory. It was his second triumph of the season after winning the Parallel Slalom on home snow in Munich in December. Austria’s slalom points leader Marcel Hirscher missed out on his fifth slalom win in the opening six races by 0.21 seconds. It didn’t stop the 23-year-old however extending his lead in the overall world cup standings to 188 points over Norway’s Aksel Lund Svindal. Rounding off the podium in third place was Croatia’s Ivica Kostelic, a four times winner of the slalom in the Swiss resort. The 2011 overall world cup champion was 0.25 seconds off the winners pace for his 12th podium in Wengen. The men’s circus travels to Kitzbuehel next weekend for a Super-G, downhill, slalom and a super-combined.
