# ORIG TITLE    Amsterdam gets ready for ‘historic day’ . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Preparations are almost complete for Tuesday’s abdication and investiture ceremonies in which Willem-Alexander will succeed his mother Queen Beatrix and become the first Dutch king in more than 120 years. Prime Minister Mark Rutte has described it as an “historic day for the country,” with one of the highlights being a cruise along the city’s waterways for the new king and his family. “They will be surrounded both on and alongside the water by the best the Netherlands has to offer. From historic ships to a joint performance by the royal concert orchestra and DJ Armin van Buuren. It will be a feast for your eyes and ears,” announced Prime Minister Rutte. Of course souvenir shops are selling everything in all sorts of styles and around a million people are expected to pack into Amsterdam’s narrow streets. But those with the best view will be the invited guests such as Britain’s Prince Charles and Camilla. With numerous VIPs expected the city is determined to be at its right royal best.
