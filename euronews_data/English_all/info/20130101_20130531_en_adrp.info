# ORIG CONTENT  Michel Djotodia, the self proclaimed president of Central African Republic, has pledged to name a power-sharing government. It is believed the leader of the Seleka rebels, who ousted President Francois Bozize on Sunday, is hoping to defuse international criticism after a military coup that killed 13 South African soldiers. Regional peacekeepers said Djotodia also appealed for their help in restoring order after it was reported his own men had joined in looting in the capital, Bangui. Seleka General, Arda Ahkoma, disputed these reports however saying: . “That’s true, there is a lot of looting, bnut not by the Seleka people. It’s the others, who are well armed and organised by Presidenbt Bozize.” . In a lightning offensive, the rebel fighters swept their way from the far north to the presidential palace in just four days. The ousting of President Bozize, who is currently in Cameroon, was condemned by the United Nations and the African Union. But in a sign of pragmatism, the US, France and regional power-broker Chad have all called on the insurgents to respect a January peace deal creating a unity government. French troops have conducted tank patrols and set up check points to restore security at the country’s main airport, though other than this France has chosen not to intervene.
