# ORIG TITLE    Judo Grand Slam Paris . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Two-time world champion Haruna Asami of Japan won the gold medal at the Judo Grand slam in Paris on Saturday after upsetting the home favourite Laetitia Payet in the under 48 kilo category. Paris has proven happy hunting ground for Asami who won her second world championship title there in 2011 – her first came the year before in Tokyo. In a closely fought contest in the French capital Asami needed the full five minutes to claim the top spot on the podium with a Waza-ari – the second highest score behind an ippon. It was her fifth grand slam crown. Naohisa Takato reigned supreme in the men’s under 60 kilo class. The 19-year-old Japanese judoka was up against South Korean Jang Jin-min and just after the two-minute mark sealed the title at Bercy with an ippon. It was a fitting end for Takato’s fourth grand slam title after arriving at the showpiece in Paris having scored an ippon in each of his previous elimination rounds.
