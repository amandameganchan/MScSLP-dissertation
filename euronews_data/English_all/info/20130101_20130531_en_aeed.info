# ORIG TITLE    North Korea advises foreign diplomats to leave . 
# ORIG CONTENT  North Korea has asked embassies in the country to consider moving their diplomats out. Amid ongoing concerns between North and South on the Korean peninsula, the move will only serve to heighten tensions. From Wednesday, the safety of embassy staff will no longer be guaranteed by the communist state. This has raised global questions over just how far North Korea is willing to take the military rhetoric. Sergey Lavrov, the Russian Foreign Minister said: “The proposal was made to all the embassies in Pyongyang, and we are now trying to clarify the situation. We asked our North Korean neighbours a number of questions we have to ask in this situation. We’re now in close contact with China, the United States, South Korea and Japan – participants in the six-party talks on North Korea’s nuclear programme”. The U.S. already has Patriot missiles in place on a base in South Korea and has recently shored up it’s military footprint with more destroyers in the Western Pacific. Former Cuban leader Fidel Castro and long-time ally of North Korea has described the situation as “one of the gravest risks of nuclear war since the Cuban Missile Crisis 50 years ago”.
