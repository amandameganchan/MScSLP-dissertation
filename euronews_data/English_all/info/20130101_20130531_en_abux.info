# ORIG TITLE    Meet Rex – the world’s first real bionic man . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A bionic man complete with artificial organs, synthetic blood and robotic limbs has gone on display at the Science Museum in London. Costing some 600,000 euros he is expensive but not as pricey as the Six Million Dollar Man of the cult 1970s TV series. The man – who is called Rex – can sense objects in front of him with retinal implants and cochlear implants to allow him to hear. He incorporates some of the latest advances in mechanical limbs, as well as a heart and lungs, an artificial pancreas, kidney, spleen and trachea, and a functional blood circulatory system. All of his components could theoretically be welded to a human body to replace missing or worn out parts.
