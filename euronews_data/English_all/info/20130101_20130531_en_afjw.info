# ORIG TITLE    Israeli official confirms airstrike on Syria . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Israeli officials have confirmed the country has carried out a strike against Syria targeting a shipment of missiles it claims were headed for Hezbollah in Lebanon. The confirmation comes after President Obama made assurance that he would not be sending US ground troops to engage in the Syrian conflict. “I do not foresee a scenario in which boots on the ground in Syria, American boots on the ground in Syria, would not only be good for America, but also would be good for Syria. And by the way when I consult with leaders in the region, they agree with that assessment,” said Obama. The Israeli strike is said to have taken place on Friday. Initial reports said the country’s air force may have targeted a chemical weapons delivery system, but that has been denied. Israel has made clear it is prepared to resort to force to prevent advanced Syrian weapons, reaching President Bashar al Assad’s Hezbollah allies.
