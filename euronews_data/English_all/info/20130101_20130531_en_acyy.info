# ORIG TITLE    Venezuela presidential election set for April 14 . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Venezuela will go to the polls to elect a new president on April 14. That’s the date announced by the country’s electoral commission following the death of Hugo Chavez last Tuesday. Meanwhile thousands of supporters of the late president are still queuing to view the body of their much loved leader. Most analysts expect acting President Nicolas Maduro to benefit from the emotional outpouring for Chavez and win his own term in office. Maduro who served as foreign minister and vice president has vowed to keep Chavez’s self-styled socialist revolution alive. He is likely to face centrist Henrique Capriles who lost to Chavez last October. The opposition has accused the government of trampling on the constitution and is furious that Maduro has been allowed to be caretaker president while he campaigns for the job.
