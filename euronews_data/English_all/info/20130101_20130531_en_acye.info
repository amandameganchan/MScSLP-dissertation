# ORIG TITLE    Kenya Election winner announced . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Uhuru Kenyatta, the son of Kenya’s founding president, has been announced as the winner of the presidential election by a slim margin. Results show that he had over 50%, which is just over the amount needed to avoid a run-off race that has divided the nation along tribal lines. Prime Minister Raila Odinga was second with over 43% of the vote. Advisors close to him have said that he would not concede the election and would launch a legal challenge if Kenyatta is declared the victor. Kenyatta’s victory will pose a dilemma for the country’s big Western donors with his trial for crimes against humanity due to begin in The Hague for orchestrating tribal violence five years ago. The Kenyan election commission’s announcement has made Kenya the second African country after Sudan to have a sitting president indicted by the International Criminal Court .
