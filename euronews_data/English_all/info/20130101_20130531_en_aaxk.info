# ORIG CONTENT  No smoke without fire as thousands of tobacco retailers take to the streets of Brussels to protest against the European Commission’s proposed restrictions on cigarettes. The directive calls for graphic warnings to cover 75 per cent of the packet and a ban on menthol and slim cigarettes. Cigarette displays inside shops will also be limited. Retailers claim the plans put 25,000 jobs at risk. “I will close the shop, I won’t be able to sell, I won’t be able to display my products, the people will come in and won’t be able to see what I have to sell, so we will close our tobacconists and we will lose our jobs,” said one retailer. Health campaigners insist that the EU has spent too much time listening to the tobacco lobby and has not been transparent about its dealings with the trade.
