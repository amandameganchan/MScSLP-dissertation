# ORIG TITLE    Press picks for Cannes Palme d’Or prize . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The clouds hanging over Cannes that brought uncharacteristic rain at the famous film festival have moved on – allowing the sun to make an appearance just in time for the ending. The red carpet for Sunday night’s closing ceremony will not be wet – and there is the excitement over which movie will be awarded the top prize of the Palme d’Or. euronews correspondent in Cannes Wolfgang Spindler asked some of the international press who their favourites are. “‘La vie d’Adèle’ (Abdellatif Kechiche) . or ‘Inside Llewyn Davis’ (Joel and Ethan Coen),” answered French journalist David Speranski. Another French journalist, Damien Aubel, said: “In my opinion, it will be either James Gray (‘The Immigrant’), Roman Polanski (‘Venus in Fur’) or the Coen brothers. I personally prefer James Gray.” . Spanish journalist Carlos Del Amor Gomez said: “My two preferred movies for the Palme d or are ‘La vie d’Adèle’, called ‘Blue is the Warmest Colour’ in English, and ‘Inside Llewyn Davis’ by the Coen brothers. I think these are the two big favourites. But it often happens that the jury and the press don’t share the same view. We’ll see what Spielberg decides.” . “I think ‘Blue is the Warmest Colour’ is the film which ticks all the right boxes. You have to remember Steven Spielberg is jury president. It’s unlikely, given his past history in the films he makes, (that) he is gonna go for something really dangerous and awkward and avant garde. It’s more likely that he will go for a warm film,” said Bristish journalist Xan Brooks. Pierpaolo La Rosa from Italy said: “My favourite film is the one by Kechiche, ‘La vie d’Adèle’. It’s an extraordinary movie which tells a love story about two young girls in a very delicate way.” . Russian journalist Elena Smolina agreed: “For me, it’s ‘La vie d’Adele’ by Abdel Kechiche.” . Another Kechiche fan was Avner Shavit, from Israel: “‘Blue is the Warmest Colour’ – it’s everybody’s favourite. I don’t think there has such a consensus in the last few years about a film.” . The 12-day festival has seen a raft of premieres and 20 films are in the running for the Palme d’Or. Australian actress Nicole Kidman and Oscar-winning director Ang Lee are part of the jury who will make the decision.
