# ORIG TITLE    NRA celebrates as Obama fights on for gun reform . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Victory is in the air at this weekend’s annual meeting of the National Rifle Association (NRA) in Houston – the first since the US Senate rejected a plan to expand background checks for gun buyers. But NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre told members that the result was not a reason to sit back and relax: . “We know that every word spoken today and throughout this weekend is going to be scrutinised by our opponents. But let me make this perfectly clear, we will never back away from our resolve to defend our rights and the rights of all law-abiding Americans and gun-owners,” LaPierre said. President Obama, who championed the bill to increase background checks, said he would not be giving up. “I will continue to do everything in my power to pass common sense reforms reforms that keep guns out of the hands of criminals and dangerous people that can save lives here in Mexico and back home in the United States,” Obama said on a visit to Mexico City. Polls show more than 80 percent of Americans agree with increased background checks. This week a five-year-old boy accidentally shot dead his two-year-old sister with a rifle he had been given for his birthday.
