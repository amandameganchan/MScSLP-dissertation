# ORIG CONTENT  Former prime minister of Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif, looks likely to become the country’s next leader after a triumphant election comeback. A stable government is expected to be formed, which could implement necessary reforms to rescue the economy from further problems. Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League does not look like it has won enough seats in the Islamabad parliament to control alone, however it can avoid forming a coalition with main rivals the Pakistan People’s Party and the PTI led by former cricketer Imran Khan. The PTI had hoped to break the dominance of the Bhutto family led PPP and Sharif’s PML, however he was unsuccessful. Despite not winning Khan’s party may become the main opposition force. The election campaign had been marred by violence. It’s expected that Sharif will press for negotiation with the Pakistan wing of the Taliban.
