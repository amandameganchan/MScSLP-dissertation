# ORIG TITLE    Deaths and desperate need for aid in flood-stricken Mozambique . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Flooding in three southern states of Mozambique has killed at least 40 people, with several reports of a death toll of up to 70. Low-lying coastal areas of the southern African country have been hit especially hard in this year’s rainy season. Flooding in 2000 killed 700 people and displaced millions. This time, boats are being used to evacuate thousands of people. Helicopters from both Mozambique and South Africa’s militaries have had to rescue those stranded on the rooftops of their homes. Around 100,000 people have been affected in Gaza province alone according to the UN, which estimates more than 11 million euros will be needed for aid to prevent the spread of diseases. The Chikahalani camp is now home to 65,000 people but only has 28 toilets.
