# ORIG CONTENT  North Korea has sentenced a US citizen to 15 years hard labour for what the Supreme Court called crimes against the country including trying to overthrow the government. Kenneth Bae who is aged 44, was held last year after entering North Korea as a tourist. He is believed to be a tour operator. He was arrested last November as he visited the northeastern port city of Rajin which is a special economic zone near the border with China. The sentence comes amid high tensions in the region after international condemnation of Pyongyangâ€™s third nuclear test. The US and South Korea are on standby against possible further provocations from the North as the two allies have just ended their joint military exercises.
