# ORIG CONTENT  Pakistani politician and former cricket star Imran Khan is being treated in hospital – after he fell more than four metres from a platform at an election rally in Lahore. Television news in Pakistan showed Khan, with visible head injuries, being carried through the crowd after the incident. He had been campaigning ahead of Pakistan’s parliamentary elections on May 11, in which his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party is expected to do well. It is unclear how badly Khan was hurt by the fall. A PTI spokesman described his injuries as “minor” and his ex-wife Jemima Khan tweeted that he was “in hospital and conscious now”.
