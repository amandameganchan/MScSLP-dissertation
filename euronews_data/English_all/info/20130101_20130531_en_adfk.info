# ORIG TITLE    Mikaela Shiffrin wins final slalom . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Rising star Mikaela Shiffrin sealed her place as the world’s number one slalom specialist by winning the season’s final race in the discipline on Saturday, March 16. The American, who turned 18 just three days earlier, put in a blistering performance on the final section of the second run to add this win to her World Cup title and World Championship gold. Second place went to Bernadette Schild of Austria. The sister of former world champion Marlies finished 0.20 seconds behind, claiming the first podium of her career. Tina Maze finished third. She had been over a second ahead of Shiffrin after the first leg, but the fatigued skiier who has had an exceptional season made a big mistake on the second and was unable to make up the time. Both women got rather emotional in the finish area – Shiffrin was overjoyed with her victory, while Maze was frustrated at missing out on the slalom title to go with her overall, giant slalom and super-G cups.
