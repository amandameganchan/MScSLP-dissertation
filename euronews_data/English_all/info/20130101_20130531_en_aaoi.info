# ORIG CONTENT  Gunshots have been fired at the headquarters of Greece’s governing New Democracy party in the capital, Athens. The building was attacked in the early hours of this morning by two men on a motorbike armed with an assault rifle according to police. The government’s spokesman, Simos Kedikoglou, said a bullet was found inside an office used occasionally by Prime Minister Antonis Samaras. No one was hurt. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack which comes after a renewed wave of politically inspired violence. On Friday, the homes of five journalists were damaged and on Sunday there was an arson attack on the home of a government spokesman’s relative. It is reported the violence may be linked to a recent police operation to remove squatters from public buildings, an operation that has been strongly condemned by the opposition.
