# ORIG TITLE    A Champions queue . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Hundreds of Borussia Dortmund fans continued to line the streets outside club’s offices on Tuesday all with one objective – to get their hands on precious tickets for the Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid. Dortmund face the Spaniards next Wednesday at their Signal-Iduna Park and fans were willing to rough it for a couple of days in a bid to land that golden ticket. One supporter said: “This is the last home match of the Champions League, you have to be there. After that thrilling quarter-final match at home you’ll do anything, anything.” . While another said: ‘‘We want to see it live. This is fantastic. On TV it is great, but to be in the stadium is just something else. I won’t sell it like many others do, that would be a real shame. To be at the match means everything to me.” . It was reported by local media ticket touts tried to push and shove their way to the front as the 66 000 thousand tickets for the match slowly but surely whittled down to just a few. Police were eventually forced to intervene and according to reports one person was taken into custody while two more were reported for aggravated battery and assault.
