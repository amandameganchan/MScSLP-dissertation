# ORIG TITLE    Britain says farewell to the Iron Lady . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The funeral is taking place at London’s St Paul’s Cathedral for the former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Thousands of people lined the streets of the capital as the cortege made its way from the Palace of Westminster down Whitehall and through the city. A debate about the ceremony’s size and scale in a time of recession has continued and over whether its appropriate for a leader whom for many is either loved or loathed. Margaret Thatcher, who ruled Britain from 1979 to 1990, died last week after suffering a stroke at the age of 87.
