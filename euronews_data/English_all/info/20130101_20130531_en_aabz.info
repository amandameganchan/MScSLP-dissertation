# ORIG TITLE    Trial begins for Olympic bottle-throwing fan . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The man that threw a bottle onto the track during the 100 metres final at the Olympic Games this summer appeared at Stratford Magistratesâ€™ Court on Thursday. The 34-year-old man named Ashley Gill-Webb went on trial for a public order offence. The court heard that Gill-Webb began shouting insults at Usain Bolt just as the Olympic Stadium fell silent in anticipation of the blue riband event. After the starting pistol had fired he then threw a beer bottle onto the track. Gill-Webb did not have a ticket to attend the final but had worked his way into an exclusive seating area, among members of the Dutch Olympic team. He was quickly confronted by Dutch judo champion Edith Bosch and then restrained by stadium workers. Gill-Webb admitted to throwing the bottle but has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
