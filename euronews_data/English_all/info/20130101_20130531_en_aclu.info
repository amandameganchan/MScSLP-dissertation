# ORIG TITLE    Italian election: ‘Super Mario’ is no more . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Italy’s outgoing Prime Minister Mario Monti, who once enjoyed approval ratings of 60 percent, has come a distant fourth place in the country’s parliamentary elections. Monti’s centrist faction won only around 10 percent of the votes in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate – according to official figures. The first of the key candidates to speak publicly following the vote, Monti criticised the whole electoral system. The outgoing Prime Minister, who has a lifelong Senate seat, also said he feels proud of what he achieved during the campaign, having only created his centrist faction a month and a half before the vote.
