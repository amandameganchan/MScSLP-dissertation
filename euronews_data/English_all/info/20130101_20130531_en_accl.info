# ORIG TITLE    Silent ‘Snow White’ is a smash at Goya awards . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The big winner at Spain’s Goya awards all but monopolised the podium this year. The black and white silent retelling of the Snow White fable ‘Blancanieves’ won 10 prizes in all, including best film and best actress. Juan Antonio Bayona’s ‘The Impossible’ took five awards including best director, although its much-praised double leads, Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts went home empty-handed. Bayona’s firm has smashed box-office records, while ‘Blancanieves’ stunned visually, including a costume prize for Paco Delgado, who is also up for an Oscar for his work on ‘Les Miserables’. The ceremony was an opportunity for critics of the government’s austerity policies to take pot shots, notably over the sky-high VAT on cultural products. But the best supporting actress winner got down to brass tacks. “In these last three years I’ve seen my father dying in a public hospital where there were no blankets to cover him, nor water for him to drink, we had to provide it. In these last three years that I have been without work I had a baby, and I don’t know what kind of public education is waiting for him. From up here I ask you for a job. I have a baby to feed. Thank you and good night,” said Candela Peña, who shone in ‘Una Pistola en Cada Mano’. The lifetime achievement award went to Concha Velasco who partied on down with verve, but the biggest crowd response of the night came when Bayona left the stage to return with Maria Belon, the survivor from the 2004 tsunami on whom ‘The Impossible’ was based.
