# ORIG CONTENT  Two planets that may be able to support some sort of life have been discovered using NASA’s Kepler space telescope. Called Kepler 62e and 62f, the two planets are beyond our solar system and in the Lyra constellation which is 1,200 light years away. They are believed to be the right size and the right distance away from their parent star to possibly have water, which could make it possible for some sort of life to flourish. About 700 planets have been discovered outside of Earth’s solar system since 1995 – but many are beyond the so-called habitable zone, an area that would be too hot or too cold for liquid water, which is considered essential for supporting life. “Studies of what the habitable zone is are ongoing and I think the most exciting thing is is this is no longer an academic theoretical exercise, because we are finding planets that really fit into these models, we can really test our new understandings of what is going on. I think it’s very exciting,” said NASA Research Scientist Thomas Barclay.
