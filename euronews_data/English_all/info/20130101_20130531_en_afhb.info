# ORIG CONTENT  The mayor of the Dhaka suburb in Bangladesh where a factory building collapsed last week causing hundreds of deaths has been suspended from office. Mohammad Refatullah is blamed for having approved the construction of the Rana Plaza. The countryâ€™s worst ever industrial accident is known to have killed at least 433 people. The figure has steadily risen as bodies continue to be brought out from under the debris. The disaster at the factory in Savar on the outskirts of Dhaka prompted a nationwide walkout by textile workers. On Thursday production re-started at all factories as staff returned to work, said Shahidullah Azim, vice-president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA). But the human cost of the tragedy is still clearly visible. Some people have refused to leave the scene while their relatives remain unaccounted for. Hundreds remain at the site armed with photos of their missing family members, while the army sets about clearing the rubble. In the face of public anger the building owner, Sohel Rana, is among eight people being held in custody. The outcry has spread well beyond the borders of Bangladesh itself.
