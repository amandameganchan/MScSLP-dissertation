# ORIG TITLE    Dark Matter, ‘Let There Be Light’ . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Shedding light on Dark Matter, the two-billion-euro cosmic ray detector on the International Space Station has physicists at NASA in the US and CERN in Europe riveted; they may have discovered the energy thought to bind our universe together. The detector found a high number of subatomic particles called positrons. Samuel Ting with the European Organisation for Nuclear Research, who is leading the AMS team, said: “I am confident that with enough time – because we will be on the Space Station for its lifetime – that we should be able to solve this [advanced mathematics] problem.” . The seven-tonne Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer was orbited two years ago. The Space Station is expected to circle earth for another seven years. Science expert Seth Borenstein said: “One of the big mysteries of the cosmos is what holds us – everything – together: what is that mysterious substance that holds the universe together? The theory for the past 80 years has been something called ‘Dark Matter’. You can’t see it but we know it’s there.” . There is a lot of number-crunching still to do before the scientists can conclusively say whether the nuclear reactions pulsing in collapsed stars out there are the proof they are looking for.
