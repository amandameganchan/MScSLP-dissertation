# ORIG TITLE    Judge withdraws from Mubarak retrial . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The presiding judge in the trial of former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has withdrawn from the case and referred it to another court. This means that there is now an indefinite adjournment of the proceedings in Cairo because Judge Mustafa Hassan Abdullah said he felt “unease” in reviewing the case. The former president is facing a retrial after he appealed a sentence of life imprisonment for the conspiring to kill protesters during the 2011 revolt that lead to the end of his 29 year rule. Over 800 people lost their lives as a result of the crackdown. Hosni Mubarak is in poor health and is being held at a military hospital in Cairo. The former interior minister Habib al-Adly and six security chiefs are in the dock again facing these charges.
