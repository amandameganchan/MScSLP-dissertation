# ORIG TITLE    Gina Lollobrigida sells for cells . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The Italian film legend Gina Lollobrigida is selling off her jewellery to raise money for stem cell research. The octogenarian said it is time to give something back for the luck she has had and she wants to leave a souvenir of her life. The silver-screen sex-siren of the 1950s and 60s might still look a million dollars, but she is hoping that the 22 items from her collection will fetch considerably more. Since bowing out from the world of film, Gina Lollobrigida has concentrated on humanitarian work and one of her first loves, sculpture. After a humble rural upbringing, fame in Italy, France and Hollywood gave her the buying power to frequent the worldâ€™s top jewellers.
