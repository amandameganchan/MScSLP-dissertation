# ORIG TITLE    Russian Soyuz docks with ISS in super-fast time . 
# ORIG CONTENT  It took just six hours after launch from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan for the latest Russian Soyuz to arrive and safely dock with the International Space Station. The super-fast time instead of the usual two days was down to orbital adjustments which have speeded things up. Astronaut Luca Parmitano, who is a former political scientist, is flying the flag for Italy, being the first from his country to be assigned a long-duration mission on board the station. Overseeing things is the veteran cosmonaut Fyodor Yurchikhin who is on his third trip and with them is US astronaut and mechanical engineer Karen Nyberg. Together with the three-man crew who are already two months into a six-month ISS mission, they will carry out more than 100 research experiments preparing the station for the delivery of a new Russian laboratory module due in December.
