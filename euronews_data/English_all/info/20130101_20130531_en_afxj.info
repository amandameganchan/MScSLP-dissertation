# ORIG CONTENT  Turkey’s prime minister says the Syrian crisis will be high on the agenda when he meets US President Barack Obama at the White House on Thursday. Ankara has thrown its weight behind the uprising against the Syrian regime. “Of course, the Syria issue will be on the table, and it will be a top priority. We will discuss what we can do in the future and what steps we can take,” said Tayyip Erdogan. He played down suggestions that a revival of talks in Geneva, which aimed to create a transitional government for Syria, would bear results. “There are some political steps which need to be taken. However, the steps that were taken through the Geneva agreement did not bring a successful result,” he continued. The meeting in America comes days after two car bombs tore through the Turkish border town of Reyhanli, killing 51 people. Ankara blamed Saturday’s attack on a group with direct links to the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. It was the deadliest spillover of violence yet.
