# ORIG CONTENT  The hostage crisis at an Algeria gas facility enters its fourth day, with more than 20 foreigners still being held captive or missing. Norwegian oil company Statoil says two more of its employees are now safe while France’s Defence Minister says no additional French hostages are being held. Shereef, an Algerian, was freed on Friday: “We were released by security forces and the army. We couldn’t escape before; bullets were flying everywhere,” he said. Plant worker Azzedin said the militants spoke in different Arabic dialects. “They were mixed. Libyan, Tunisian, Egyptian, Mauritanian, and some spoke French.” . As the standoff between the army and al Qaeda-linked gunmen continued, reports put the number of hostages killed at between 12 and 30. The remote In Amenas gas processing plant sits 100 kilometres west of the Libyan border. Algerian forces continue to surrounding the facility with gunman and hostages holed up within the compound.
