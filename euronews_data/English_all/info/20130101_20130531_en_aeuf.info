# ORIG CONTENT  Fury has once again erupted in the Indian capital, New Delhi, as protests over the authorities handling of the rape and torture of a five-year-old girl continue. Outside the home of Congress party chief, Sonia Gandhi, crowds demanded that the government ensures the safety of women in the city. Protesters also called for the resignation of the New Delhi police chief amid allegations officers ignored complaints from the family that the girl was missing.

Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh admitted India needed to improve the safety, security and status of women in the country. The girl went missing last Monday and was found 48 hours later in a room in the same building where she lived with her family. She was found alone sobbing suffering from internal injuries and severe bites to her face and torso, she had been repeatedly raped. The girl is responding well to treatment in hospital. A 24-year-old man is in police custody. The latest attack comes one month after a medical student was gang raped on a Delhi bus, she later died from her injuries.
