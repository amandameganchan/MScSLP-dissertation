# ORIG CONTENT  Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi has declared a state of emergency in three cities along the Suez Canal. In a televised address, Morsi ordered a nightly curfew in Port Said, Ismailia and Suez, starting on Monday evening. Cairo, meanwhile, has endured its fourth day of clashes on the streets. Protesters and police confronted each other near Tahrir Square, the crucible of the 2011 uprising. Tear gas was fired and demonstrators responded by throwing rocks. They are angry at what they see as a power-grab by orthodox muslim politicians. “We want President Morsi to be removed” cried one protester, “and we would like to cleanse the Interior Ministry and the government. We got rid of Mubarak and so we will be able to get rid of Morsi.” . According to state television, seven people were shot dead and hundreds were injured here in Port Said during the funerals of 33 protesters killed at the weekend. At least 49 have died across the country.
