# ORIG TITLE    Americans go green for St. Patrick . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Going Green took on a whole new meaning in Chicago when the city’s river was turned a gaudy hue in celebration of St. Patrick’s Day. All across the US, Americans have been out in force to mark the March 17 festival. With the holiday falling on a Sunday many celebrations have taken place a day early because of religious observances. Marching bands led the parade in New York which is one of the oldest and predates the United States. Michael Bloomberg waved to the cheering crowds taking in his last St. Patrick’s Day parade as the city’s mayor. And in Savannah Georgia thousands turned out to enjoy the spectacle with some steeling a traditional lucky kiss. Of course no one can beat Ireland, where Dublin’s celebrations of the country’s patron saint last a whole five days.
