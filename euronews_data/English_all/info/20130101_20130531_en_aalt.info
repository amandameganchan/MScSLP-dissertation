# ORIG TITLE    One student seriously injured in California school shooting . 
# ORIG CONTENT  There has been another school shooting in the US, this time with one student critically wounded at Taft Union High School in Kern County, California. Two pupils were shot at by a gunman, who is also believed to attend the school. Police say the suspected shooter was convinced into putting down his weapon after speaking to a teacher and another student. This comes as the US Vice President Joe Biden says he will report gun control proposals to Barack Obama by next Tuesday – before the President’s end of January deadline. “There is an emerging set of recommendations not coming from me but coming from the groups we have met with, and I am going to focus on the ones that relay primarily to gun ownership and the types of weapons that you own,” said Biden. Gun control has been a large part of the political agenda in the US since the killing of 20 children and six adults in a shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut almost one month ago.
