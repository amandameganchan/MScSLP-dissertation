# ORIG TITLE    Red carpet robot . 
# ORIG CONTENT  In the world of film, grabbing attention is important but the competition is intense. Just how do you get the attention of the world’s film fans, let alone Hollywood A-listers? What about a robotic reporter? A fully programmable state-of-the-art humanoid robot? One film website in Germany (flimmer.de) thought it was a good idea. Please welcome RoboThespian, otherwise known as Roli. Christopher Zwickler, film producer and the manager of Flimmer, explained: “Berlin is the capital of premieres, a lot is happening here. We are very close to the action. We were asking ourselves how we could report from all these premieres? Are we just going to be the 35th camera team on the red carpet or can we do something else?” . Roli started work at the premiere of “Schlussmacher”, a new German comedy, by interviewing Matthias Schweighöfer, the director, producer and lead actor in the film. He then went on to make polite chit-chat with pop band Blue. For more information about “Schlussmacher” see .
