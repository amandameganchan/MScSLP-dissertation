# ORIG TITLE    Suspects in India rape case appear in court . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Five men accused of the gang rape and murder of an Indian student are appearing in court for the first time. They will be read the charges against them in a procedural step before a trial date is set. The five men, along with a teenager, are charged with the rape, abduction and murder of the 23-year-old physiotherapy student last month after a hour-long bus journey in New Delhi. She died two weeks later of her injuries in a Singapore hospital. Prosecutors say they are seeking the death penalty in the case given what they call the “heinous” nature of the crime. The sixth member of the gang will be tried in a separate juvenile court and face a maximum three year sentence. The attack on the student has provoked widespread protests against the government and anger towards the police for their perceived failure to protect women, and rare national debate about violence against women.
