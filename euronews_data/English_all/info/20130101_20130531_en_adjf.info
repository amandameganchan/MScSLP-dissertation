# ORIG CONTENT  A series of car bombs and a suicide attack have reportedly killed dozens of people and wounded many more in Shi’ite districts in and around the Iraqi capital Baghdad. It comes on the 10th anniversary of the US-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein. The car bombs exploded near a busy market close to the heavily defended Green Zone, as well as in other parts of the city. Reports speak of a total of nine blasts, targeting small businesses and groups of people in the street. “Innocent people were having breakfast and all of a sudden a car bomb went off. You can see the damage, houses were demolished. Can God accept that?” said one man. Another witness said his taxi was rocked by the blast and described scenes of panic. Hospital officials were quoted as saying 160 people were wounded in the attacks. Elsewhere, south of Baghdad, a suicide bomber driving a truck attacked a police base. Sunni insurgents have stoked sectarian tension with several attacks this year in a campaign to undermine Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki’s government, while Iraq’s al Qaeda wing has vowed to reclaim lost territory. Last week gunmen and suicide bombers stormed the well-protected Justice Ministry building in central Baghdad, killing 25 people.
