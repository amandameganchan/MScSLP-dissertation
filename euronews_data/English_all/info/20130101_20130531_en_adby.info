# ORIG TITLE    Arsenal exit Champions League on away goals rule . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Lacklustre Bayern Munich advanced to the Champions League quarter-finals on Wednesday despite losing 2-0 to Arsenal in Munich to book their ticket on the away goals rule. Olivier Giroud netted in the third minute to give the Gunners early hope after their 3-1 first leg defeat last month as they tried to become only the third team ever to advance in the knockout stage after losing the first leg at home. Laurent Koscielny set up a nervous finale when he headed in their second goal five minutes from time but Arsenal failed to grab a third that would have sent them through. Arsenal’s exit means that there will be no Champions League quarter-finalist from England for the first time since the 1995/96 season. Elsewhere debutants Malaga kept their Champions League dream alive when Isco and substitute Roque Santa Cruz struck in a 2-0 win at home to 10-man Porto that sent the La Liga side through to the last eight 2-1 on aggregate. Playmaker Isco put Malaga ahead with a brilliant curling effort two minutes before halftime and Porto’s hopes were dealt a further blow four minutes after the break when midfielder Steven Defour was shown a second yellow card and sent off. Malaga probed patiently for a second and Santa Cruz headed into the net from Isco’s corner in the 77th minute, moments after coming off the bench, to seal the win. Barcelona (Spain) .
