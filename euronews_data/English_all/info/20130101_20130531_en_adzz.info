# ORIG TITLE    Douglas-Hamilton flies over Everest 80-years after first flight . 
# ORIG CONTENT  On the 80th anniversary of the first manned flight over Everest by British pilot Douglas Douglas-Hamilton, his grandson Charles repeated the journey. On April 3, 1933 Douglas-Hamilton and Flight Lieutenant David Fowler MacIntyre flew two open-cockpit biplanes at around 9,150 metres barely clearing the summit. Charles was able to enjoy all the luxury of modern aviation however. Many Nepali airlines now offer flights around some of the world’s highest peaks in the Himalayas. The original Everest flights grabbed international headlines and a documentary film “Wings Over Everest” won an Oscar in 1934.
