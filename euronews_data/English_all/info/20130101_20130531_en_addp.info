# ORIG TITLE    France signals it may break EU arms embargo on Syria with Britain . 
# ORIG CONTENT  France has joined Britain by indicating it may be ready to break ranks with the rest of the EU and question the utility of the arms embargo for the Free Syrian Army. Up against a Syrian army with access to Russian and Chinese weaponry the Free Syrian Army rebels are struggling to gain ground. Now France has said it may be ready to go it alone. “Lifting the arms embargo is one of the only ways left to politically influence the situation. Our position, which we share with the British, is to now ask Europe to lift the embargo so that the resistants can defend themselves,” said Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius on French radio. “And if the EU refuses, what will France do?” asked the interviewer; . “France is a sovereign nation, madam,” was his reply. The one unknown is how many of the weapons that may eventually be supplied could fall into the hands of the Islamist groups fighting the Assad regime alongside the Free Army, an outcome that would be unwelcome in London and Paris.
