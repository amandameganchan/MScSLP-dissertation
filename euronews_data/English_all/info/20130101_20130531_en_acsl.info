# ORIG TITLE    Mississippi: baby ‘cured’ of HIV . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A baby girl in Mississippi who was born with HIV has been cured according to US researchers. The girl was treated with a cocktail of standard HIV fighting drugs from just hours after her birth and at 29-days-old the virus was undetectable. After 18-months the baby then stopped the treatment for 10 months and the virus didn’t return. Beborah Persaud a virologist at John Hopkins Children’s Center said: . “So follow-up labs at 23 months showed.. standard viral load test showed an undetectable viral load at less than 20 copies per millilitre. And a repeat was drawn with the idea that perhaps this was a lab error. A repeat test done two weeks later again showed less than 20 copies per millilitre.” . The child’s story differs from that of Timothy Ray Brown, the so-called “Berlin patient” who was cured using an elaborate leukaemia treatment in 2007. This case could offer insights into how to eradicate HIV from its youngest victims using standard medication.
