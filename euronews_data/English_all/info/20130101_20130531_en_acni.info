# ORIG TITLE    Zombies in Warm Bodies . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Canadian film Warm Bodies is a spoof on the whole teeny Twilight genre with a sly poke at Romeo and Juliet thrown in for good measure. It’s funny, quirky, feel-good and bound to appeal to teens as well as to their parents. John Malkovich plays the Daddy Capulet character: “In this film there’s quite of bit of play I think with the zombie genre and quite a bit of movement in the characters which you wouldn’t normally see. And in this there are kind of zombies and then kind of extreme zombies. This film is let’s say, less zombiefied, zombies. Some of them have many human traits so I think it’s kind of in sync for that reason.” . The movie is based on the debut novel, “Warm Bodies”, by author Isaac Marion. For more information see .
