# ORIG CONTENT  The British Academy of Film and Television Arts heralded the build up to its prestigious awards ceremony by unveiling the nominations for its Rising Star award. Twenty-three-year-old British actress Juno Temple is one of four females nominated in the category, the only one voted for by the public. The jury selected the shortlist from hundreds of submissions. “I think with all of these nominees what you are talking about is somebody whose reputation is recognised within the industry but it is an endorsement from the public which really provides a boost to your career,” said film critic and jury member, Mark Kermode. Juno Temple’s breakthrough role came in the 2006 movie Notes on a Scandal alongside Cate Blanchett. She subsequently appeared in Atonement and The Dark Night Rises. “I love what I do, I love working. I want to do it until the day I die and I think what is so amazing for me is that proves fighting and being passionate about something is right, I am doing the right thing,” she enthused. Juno Temple’s most recent appearance was in William Friedkin’s Killer Joe. Ninteen-year-old actor Suraj Sharma is the only male to be shortlisted for the award. The result of the public vote will be announced at the awards ceremony on February 10.
