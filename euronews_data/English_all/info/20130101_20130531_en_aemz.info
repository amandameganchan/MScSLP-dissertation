# ORIG TITLE    Violence returns to Somalia as 19 are killed in Mogadishu . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The Somali capital Mogadishu has been hit by its worst violence this year with at least 19 people killed in two separate terrorist attacks. Al Shabaab militants exploded a car bomb outside the law courts as gunmen stormed the compound, then later another bomb was set off near an African Union and Turkish Red Crescent convoy on their way to the airport. Government soldiers had to lay siege to the law courts after an estimated seven well-armed men seized control and swept through the building killing anyone in sight. At least three of them detonated explosive vests during the gunbattle, which lasted several hours. Although al Shabaab has been expelled from most of Somalia’s major cities and towns it still controls much of the countryside. British intelligence warned last week terrorists were “in the final stages” of planning an attack on the city.
