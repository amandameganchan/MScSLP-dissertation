# ORIG TITLE    Airlines boots health screens against new coronavirus . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Shares in Europe’s leading airlines have fallen amid fears that the fatal coronavirus can be transmitted among people. New screening measures are set to be introduced but the prospect of disruption to air travel and passengers is already affecting the industry. British Airways and its rival Air France-KLM have both lost nearly five percent, the sharpest drop since April when they retreated following concerns over a bird-flu virus in China. Germany’s Lufthansa, Europe’s second-biggest airline, slid as much as 3.5 percent before trading 2.7 percent lower at 15.66 euros in Frankfurt. The SARS outbreaks a decade ago severely curtailed air travel, pushing carriers to significant losses.
