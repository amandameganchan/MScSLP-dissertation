# ORIG TITLE    Bulgaria’s GERB want election they won cancelled . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Winners of Sunday’s parliamentary election in Bulgaria, the centre-right GERB party, want the result cancelled because of possible irregularities after photocopied voting slips were found in a printing shop. Unpopular GERB leader and former prime minister Borisov Boikov stands little chance of forming a coalition. GERB won 97 out of 240 seats, but no other party wants to join an administration with them.
