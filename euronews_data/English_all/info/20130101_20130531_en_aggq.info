# ORIG TITLE    Community tensions rise as police investigate London soldier murder . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Flowers have been laid at the scene where a British soldier was killed near the Woolwich army barracks in south east London. Police are still trying to establish what happened on Wednesday afternoon. Witnesses say two men used a car to run down the victim whom they then attacked with knives and a machete shouting “Allahu Akbar- God is Great.” . Around twenty minutes later a police armed response unit arrived and shot the men but not before one of the suspects was filmed by a passer-by justifying his actions. “We swear by almighty Allah we will never stop fighting you. The only reason we have done this is because Muslims are dying every day…This British soldier is an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth,” says the suspected attacker. “You people will never be safe. Remove your government. They don’t care about you.” .

The killing sparked a terror alert with suspicions raised that this was a possible jihadist attack. One of the alleged killers is reportedly 28-year-old Michael Adebolajo – British but of Nigerian descent. Muslim leaders in the UK have strongly condemned the attack declaring it was not carried out in the name of Islam. Many fear a backlash against Britain’s Muslim community raising the spectre of more Islamophobia. Muslim Political commentator, Mohammed Ansar, said: “What we have seen is a ratcheting up of tensions, we have seen hysteria about Muslims and Islam, fear and hatred and xenophobia against foreigners and immigrants and, in that political caldron, these kind of sparks can cause real, real damage and that is the danger, that communities do not turn on themselves.” . But as police investigate whether the killing was part of a terrorist plot or carried out by so-called ‘lone wolves’, there have already been two attacks on mosques in the south east of England. The British National Party has issued anti-immigration statements and last night members of the far right English Defence League (EDL)clashed with police. “Enough’s enough. Our message is – enough’s enough, “ said EDL leader Tommy Robinson. “We have weak leaders, weak police. Our police, our leaders tiptoe around this issue. This issue is political Islam. It’s political Islam that’s spreading across this country.” . Footage of English Defence League members in Woolwich after the attack: .
