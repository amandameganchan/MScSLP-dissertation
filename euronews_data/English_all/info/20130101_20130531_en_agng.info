# ORIG CONTENT  Champions of Europe and now champions in the financial charts – Bayern Munich have leapfrogged Manchester United in brand value according to a new survey. Ratings firm Brand Finance believes the German Bundesliga champions are now worth some 668 million euros, compared to United’s 650 million, and they have a solid base for becoming even bigger. Brand Finance’s Chief Executive Officer David Haigh said: “Well the German clubs are very special because they have been growing very fast in the last few years and that’s because their management model is probably better than the UK one. The things that they are doing right are that they are looking after their fans by not charging them too much so they have very very high season ticket holder numbers and full stadiums.” . What’s more Brand Finance says Bayern’s value go swell even higher if they complete the treble this weekend and beat Stuttgart in the German Cup final on Saturday.
