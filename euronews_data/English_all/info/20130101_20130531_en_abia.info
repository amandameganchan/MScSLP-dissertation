# ORIG TITLE    “Global Conversation” for Hillary Clinton . 
# ORIG CONTENT  In Washington, Hillary Clinton has taken part in a globally linked-up question and answer session. It is part of a week-long series of meetings, conferences and ceremonies before the US Secretary of State quits power and hands the baton on to John Kerry. She cited learning the art of compromise as the most difficult professional challenge she had faced. “You can be partisan, you can have a strong sense of the rightness of your position, but democracy and certainly legislative bodies require compromise. And you cannot let compromise become a dirty word, because then you veer towards fanaticism.” . Hillary Clinton may be saying goodbye to the world of diplomacy – but speculation is rife that we haven’t seen the last of her yet. She deftly fielded questions about running for President in 2016. “I am looking forward to finishing up my tenure as Secretary of State and then catching up on about 20 years of sleep deprivation.” . The event in Washington was also trending on Twitter with users participating on Facebook, Youtube and Skype.
