# ORIG TITLE    Netanyahu to go for a “broad coalition” . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has emerged from Israel’s election poised to form its next government, according to exit polls.   He wasted no time in evoking what he sees as the major threat to Israel: Iran’s potential nuclear capability.   But the issue barely registered during the campaign. Only 10 percent of Israelis thought it important compared to 47 percent for social and economic issues.    “The government we are going to form will be based on five principles. First and foremost, the security capability to deal with the threats we face. And the main threat was and still is to prevent Iran getting a nuclear weapon.”, Netanyahu told reporters at a post-poll rally.    The strong showing of centre and left parties, mainly among the young vote, means Netanyahu is likely to have to give them a seat at the table as well. The head of the right-wing Likud party already aligned in a single bloc with the ultranationalist Yisrael Beitenu group, hopes to put together a broad majority in the 120 member Knesset.    Work will get underway as soon as possible to choose a functioning coalition to govern Israel.    .
