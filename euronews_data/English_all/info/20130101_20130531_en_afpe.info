# ORIG TITLE    Hungary’s ballad to win Eurovision? . 
# ORIG CONTENT  ByeAlex is the Eurovision hopeful from Hungary – although originally he was not the obvious choice. In early rounds of the competition, nobody really expected him to win. Nevertheless, he was the voters’ choice. His song is a simple ballad called “My Darling” which deals with unconditional love. He is a philosophy graduate, and wrote the song himself. He explained: “I went through a difficult time in life and that was when I created an ideal character. We should all have one in our lives. A character within an idealised world. Many people say it’s “like a fairy tale” perhaps because they don’t believe someone like that can exist in real life, but it can and this is what my song is about.” . Originally ByeAlex was not that keen to enter the contest as he dislikes publicity and the celebrity world. As a journalist, ByeAlex has some interesting opinions about pop music in Hungary: “In Hungary pop music has been westernised. We want our music to sound exactly the same as in the UK or the US. But the difference with those countries is that pop music is their conventional music. Here there was, maybe 10-15 years ago, a big turnaround to westernise music and perhaps now this is turning back because people did not vote for a conventional pop song for Eurovision but for a song that means a lot for many people.” . ByeAlex says at Eurovision he will perform his song in Hungarian with English subtitles.
