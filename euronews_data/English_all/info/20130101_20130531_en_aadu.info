# ORIG CONTENT  The father of an Indian gang rape victim, who died of her injuries, is demanding the death penalty for her attackers. He spoke after scattering the ashes of his 23-year-old daughter in the River Ganges, in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. Five men have been charged with rape and murder. A sixth suspect, who is under 18, will be tried separately. The victim and her family are not being identified. “I support the nation’s plea to award the death sentence,” the father said. “Even if the rapist is a juvenile the punishment for the heinous crime should be same.” . Last month’s attack, which happened on a bus in New Delhi, has led to widespread protests. The government stands accused of failing to do enough to protect women, in a country where – on average – a rape is reported every 20 minutes. Ministers have set up two panels to recommend new safety measures.
