The people will have him in his museum of the revolution. Like Ho-Chi-Min, like Lenin, like Mao,” Maduro said. Mourner Leonardo Murga, who has seen Chavez’s body, said it had a “good” appearance: “It’s not like we are going to say, ‘how sad, how thin’. He is normal, robust!” . A state funeral is due to be held on March 8. The wake will continue for another week, then Chavez’s body will be laid to rest.
