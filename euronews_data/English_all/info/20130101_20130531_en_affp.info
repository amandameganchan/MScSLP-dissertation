# ORIG CONTENT  Celebrating the Feast of Saint Joseph the Worker, Pope Francis has used the occasion to condemn “slave labour” carried out by employees at the collapsed factories in Bangladesh. Making an address on May Day, Pope Francis said: “I think of how many, and not just young people, are unemployed, often due to a purely economic conception of society that seeks selfish profit outside the parameters of social justice.” . According to a report by Vatican Radio, Pope Francis made the remark about the Bangladeshi workers during a private mass. The Pontiff is said to have been shocked by the news that some of the 400 victims were living on 38 euros per month. Pope Francis is the first Jesuit Pope, a group known for their vow of poverty.
