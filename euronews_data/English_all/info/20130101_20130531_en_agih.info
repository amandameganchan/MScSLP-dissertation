# ORIG CONTENT  Residents of Mount Vernon, Washington are counting their lucky stars after a dramatic bridge collapse. Cars were sent plunging into the icy Skagit river north of Seattle, but no-one was killed as the four-lane bridge on Interstate 5, the main vehicle link between Seattle and Vancouver, failed without warning. One local man said traffic had been much heavier in the evening rush hour just an hour earlier. Three motorists needed rescuing from the shallow waters, and three required hospital treatment. Authorities are investigating the possibility that an over-sized truck load hit the 58 year-old bridge just before the section collapsed.
