# ORIG CONTENT  Ghana’s John Dramani Mahama has been sworn in as president pledging to focus on development and to unite the country. Despite an opposition boycott over last month’s disputed election, several African heads of state attended the inauguration. While thousands of supporters showed their enthusiasm, Mahama’s rival Nana Akufo-Addo has accused the new president of rigging the tightly fought poll. However international observers gave the election a clean bill of health despite some technical problems. Earlier a new parliament took office in the country which has become Africa’s newest oil exporter.
