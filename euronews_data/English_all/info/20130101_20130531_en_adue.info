# ORIG CONTENT  Former South Africa President Nelson Mandela is back in hospital due to a recurring lung infection. The 94-year-old anti-apartheid leader was admitted on Wednesday night. He is said to have been conscious when he arrived at hospital. A statement described Mandela as receiving “best possible expert medical treatment and comfort”. A lung infection and an operation to remove gallstones kept Mandela in hospital in Pretoria for three weeks in December, including over the Christmas period. Mandela lives in Qunu, a small rural village in Eastern Cape province and rarely makes public appearances.
