# ORIG CONTENT  Pope Francis led the Good Friday service in St Peter’s Basilica to mark Christ’s death on the cross. Papal preacher Father Raniero Cantalamessa called on the Pope to lead the church back to simplicity. As night fell he attended the Stations of the Cross procession around the 2,000 year old Colosseum,. This year members of the Lebanese faithful attended the ritual and they urged peace in a region torn by “injustice and conflict.” . Pope Francis addressed the pilgrims and held out a hand to Muslims across the globe. “We saw the beauty and the strength of the Christian communion from Lebanon and and the friendship of so many Muslim brothers: and many others,” he said.
