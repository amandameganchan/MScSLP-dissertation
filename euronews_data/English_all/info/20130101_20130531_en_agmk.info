# ORIG CONTENT  The World Health Organisation has suspended its polio eradication programme in the Pakistani city of Peshawar after gunmen attacked two health workers. One woman died at the scene, the other is said to be in a critical condition. It is believed they had declined police escorts. “Our workers don’t want to have security guards right next to them.They suggested they would only be happy if they kept their distance,” said a colleague of the two women. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack but the Pakistani Taliban banned polio vaccinations in parts of the tribal belt last year claiming the drive was cover for espionage. The authorities have been deploying security forces with health teams in the vaccination programme since December, when a series of shootings in different cities of Pakistan killed nine health volunteers.
