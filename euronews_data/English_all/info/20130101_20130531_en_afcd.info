# ORIG TITLE    Italy’s new cabinet sworn in . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Italy’s presidential palace played host to the swearing-in of the country’s newly formed cabinet. President Giorgio Napolitano, himself only recently inaugurated for an unprecedented second term, was on hand to preside over the ceremony. In keeping with the theme, newly-appointed premier Enrico Letta took the oath before 21 ministers took their posts. His cabinet boasts a record number of women, including Italy’s first Foreign Minister Emma Bonino and the first black female minister, Cecile Kyenge, the Minister of Integration. The coalition brings together Letta’s own Democratic Party and Silvio Berlusconi’s People of Freedom party. Although the former prime minister is not part of the new cabinet, he is well represented by Angelino Alfano, his party secretary and now Deputy Prime Minister. Critics are sceptical such a fractured coalition can last. The cabinet has it’s first meeting at 1pm at the government headquarters.
