# ORIG TITLE    Syria: violence flares in Damascus, refugee crisis escalates . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Fierce fighting has broken out in the Syrian capital Damascus. Footage posted online by activists opposed to President Bashar al-Assad purportedly shows smoke pouring from a mosque in the Jobar district. Opposition activists also uploaded video to the Internet showing what they say was government shelling in eastern parts of the city, held by rebels, on February 6 and 7. Elsewhere, a car bomb killed 19 security officers. The United Nations says around 700,000 Syrian refugees have fled abroad – almost a third of them to Lebanon. In a new report titled “Misery Beyond the War Zone”, aid organisation Medicin Sans Frontiers (MSF) says the neighbouring country is unable to cope. MSF says Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley refugee camps do not have the resources to provide adequate shelter and healthcare for everyone. As the humanitarian crisis escalates, 70,000 more Syrians are awaiting processing to enter Lebanon.
