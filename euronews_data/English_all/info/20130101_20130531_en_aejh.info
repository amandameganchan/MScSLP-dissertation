# ORIG CONTENT  The death toll following a powerful earthquake in Iran has risen to 37 according to state media, with some 850 injured. The 6.3 magnitude quake struck near the countryâ€™s only nuclear power station, but Iranian authorities and its Russian builders say the facility is undamaged. Around 700 mud and brick homes were destroyed by the quake and rescue efforts continued into the night. The Red Crescent which is providing survivors with food and shelter was searching for survivors in the rubble. The epicentre was 89km southeast of the port of Bushehr. Across the gulf offices in Qatar and Bahrain were evacuated and the shock was also felt in the financial hub of Dubai. Iran is the only country operating a nuclear plant that does not belong to the Convention on Nuclear Safety, negotiated after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. The Bushehr reactor continues to be a source of concern as it sits at the intersection of three tectonic plates.
