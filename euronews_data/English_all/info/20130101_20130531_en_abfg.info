Another man spoke of the sadness of losing his son. “My son was full of life,” he told reporters, “and full of health at 27 years old.” . Footage captured on mobile phones inside the nightclub showed massive confusion and panic. More than 100 people are being treated in hospital after breathing in smoke. The first funerals will be held today. President Dilma Roussef has cut short a visit to Chile to return to Brazil to visit relatives of the victims and survivors.
