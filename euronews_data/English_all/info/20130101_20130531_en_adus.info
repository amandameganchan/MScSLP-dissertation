# ORIG TITLE    Womb to rent – the harsh realities of surrogacy . 
# ORIG CONTENT  In a clinic in Ukraine surrogate mothers carry babies for couples who otherwise would be childless. It is legal but not without controversy with some who believe it is nothing short of a money making business. In most EU countries surrogacy as well as egg donors are not allowed. It means Ukraine has become a key destination for Europeans in search of a surrogate mother. Going to another country where surrogacy is legal while at home it’s not, paying someone to carry a baby you otherwise would never be able to have, taking a risk that you can’t bring your child home – the surrogacy issue is emotive and complex. For some in Europe it is a price worth paying for the gift of parenthood. Euronews reports from Ukraine and France and talks to couples, doctors and surrogate mothers.
