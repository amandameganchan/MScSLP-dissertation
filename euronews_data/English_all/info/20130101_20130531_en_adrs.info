# ORIG TITLE    Syria’s opposition divided . 
# ORIG CONTENT  An Arab summit starting on March 27 looks set to expose the divisions in the Syrian opposition. The resignation of Moaz Alkhatib, from the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, on March 24 threw the group into disarray. Alkhatib did not give a reason for his decision to step down but hinted at frustration at those who attempted to undermine him after he called for talks with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Some say it could be an astute move to distance himself from an opposition movement that is doomed to failure. Th rapid election of Ghassan Hitto as provisional Prime Minister has also divided the various factions. On March 26 amateur footage purported to show ongoing fierce fighting between rebel soldiers and Assad’s forces in the Syrian capital, Damascus. On the same day it was reported that Colonel Riad al-Asaad, the founder of the Free Syrian Army (FSA), had his leg blown off by an explosion in an apparent assassination attempt. His wounds were said to be non life-threatening and he was transported to a hospital in Turkey for treatment.
