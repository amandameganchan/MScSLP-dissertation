Benedict XVI said: “The Lord is calling me to climb onto the mountain, to dedicate myself even more to prayer and meditation. “But this does not mean abandoning the Church. Actually, if God asks this of me, it is precisely because I can continue to serve Him with the same dedication and the same love.” . Pope Benedict, 85, has decided to step down due to his age and declining health.
