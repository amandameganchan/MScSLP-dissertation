# ORIG TITLE    Faith and football . 
# ORIG CONTENT  If football is a religion for many of its fans, for some of those studying in the seminaries of Vatican City, religion is also football. The Clericus Cup is an annual five-a-side tournament involving seminarians and priests in the Catholic Churchâ€™s equivalent of the Champions League. The tournament is hotly contested with 16 teams and more than 70 different countries represented. Organised into a series of league and play-off games, the Cup sees teams take on each other in highly competitive yet good-natured and brotherly games of football until one of them is eventually crowned champion.
