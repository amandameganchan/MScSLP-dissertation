# ORIG TITLE    Davos: leaders look to ‘resilient dynamism’ . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The world’s power elite are gathered at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos focusing on how countries and companies can survive the global financial turmoil. With the recovery slow at best, the mood remains cautious among the presidents, prime ministers, top government officials, business executives, bank bosses and heads of non-governmental organisations. The theme this year at Davos is “resilient dynamism”, indicating a feeling that now is the time to move on from years of economic crisis management. As the event’s founder Klaus Schwab said: “My hope is that you come out of this meeting with a vision which goes beyond just the crisis management that we have seen in the past, a vision that is much more dynamic and which is not just crisis fighting.” . At the forum, some delegates voiced concern about a lack of leadership and co-ordination to address global issues. Outside there were protests against ethical violations by multinational companies calling for greater accountably for their behaviour on human-rights and the environment.
