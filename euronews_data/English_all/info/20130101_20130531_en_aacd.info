# ORIG TITLE    Turkey’s ex-army chief detained over “post-modern coup” . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Turkey’s former armed forces chief has been briefly detained over an investigation into the military’s role in pushing the country’s first Islamist-led government out of power. Ismail Hakki Karadayi was chief of general staff from 1994 to 1998. Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan resigned in June 1997, months after the military-dominated National Security Council warned him over policies it perceived as undermining the secular constitution. The episode was dubbed Turkey’s “post-modern coup” as the generals applied pressure behind the scenes to force him from power.
