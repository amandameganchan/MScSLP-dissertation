# ORIG TITLE    Britons pay their respects as Thatcher’s body leaves the Ritz . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The body of the late Baroness Thatcher has now been moved from London’s Ritz Hotel, where she spent her final days before dying at the age of 87. The first and only female British Prime Minister will be honoured with a service of a scale not seen for a former premier since that of Winston Churchill half a century ago. She will receive a ceremonial funeral with full military honours at St Paul’s Cathedral in around a weeks time. While famously divisive, many outside the five-star hotel were there to show their respect and appreciation to the Iron Lady. One woman said: “Just the fact that she was a woman, I think that’s already a big thing. Because obviously, in parliament, men dominate it.” . Another added: “She came from a lower side of the society and she was very ambitious to be a prime minister. So I respect her because she did a lot.” . Some Conservative MPs had called for a full state funeral, but its understood that Thatcher herself had decided against that saying it would be “inappropriate” for her to lie-in-state and requested there be no fly-past as it would be a waste of tax-payers money.
