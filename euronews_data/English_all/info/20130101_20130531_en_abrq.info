# ORIG CONTENT  Newcomer Mikky Ekko has teamed up with Rihanna on her new album Unapologetic. He says he has no idea how she heard his song Stay: “I wrote the song for me, I wrote it with my buddy Justin Parker here in London, about a year ago. And to this day nobody in my camp knows how she heard about it. My management called me and they said ‘Hey, Rihanna’s heard the track ‘Stay’ and she wants to put it on her record.’ I went ha ha bloop, and I hung up the phone. And then they called me back and were like ‘no we were actually being serious.’ And I was like ok, I don’t even know what to think about that.” . The song is included on Rihanna’s new album Unapologetic which is out now.
