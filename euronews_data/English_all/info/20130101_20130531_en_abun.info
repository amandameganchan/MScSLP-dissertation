# ORIG TITLE    Eastern Western . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The Russian Berlinale entry is titled A Long and Happy Life but tells a grim tale of corruption, greed and pride. It is about one man’s abrupt coming of age and is set in the rural north – a sort of Russian Western, as director Boris Khlebnikov explains: “This is not just a remake, rather it is a sort of contemplation on the topic of the film “High Noon” and how it could have been remade Russian-style and who would be the enemy and who would be the hero. “When I started thinking about it I realised that in the Russian situation there can be no absolute evil and absolute good, everything is totally mixed.” .
