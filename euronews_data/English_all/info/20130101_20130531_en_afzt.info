# ORIG TITLE    Jewels meant for stars stolen at Cannes Film Festival . 
# ORIG CONTENT  French police say jewels due to be lent to film stars at the Cannes Film Festival have been stolen from a hotel room. Worth more than three quarters of a million euros, they were taken early on Friday morning, in a part of town separate from the site of the festival. As ever, it has attracted thousands of film stars, industry executives and others to the Mediterranean resort. The room had been rented by an employee of the Swiss jeweller Chopard, one of the festival’s sponsors. A police source said a safe containing the jewels had been pulled out and taken away. Chopard is the official supplier of the Palme d’Or, which is presented to the director of the best film. The trophy itself is said to be safe. The stolen jewels had been destined to be loaned out to celebrities while walking the red carpet. This is the third year in a row that significant thefts have been reported in Cannes during the festival.
