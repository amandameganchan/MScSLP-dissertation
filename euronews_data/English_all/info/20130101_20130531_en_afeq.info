# ORIG TITLE    Former Pakistani president Musharraf banned from elections . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Pakistanâ€™s former president Pervez Musharraf has been given a lifetime ban from contesting elections. A high court dismissed his prior appeal against disqualification. The judge said he had ordered senior judges and their families to be put under house arrest and twice overrode the constitution. The former army chief had returned from a self-imposed exile after almost four years hoping to enter the general election on May 11. But with court cases pending against him, he fell foul of authorities determined to make him answer to a crackdown on the judiciary during his time in office. Musharraf will now be in detention on remand on the day of the general election.
