# ORIG TITLE    CIA and FBI were warned about Boston bomb suspect . 
# ORIG CONTENT  As Boston comes to terms with the twin marathon bombings, American security agencies are back in the spotlight over the attacks. The CIA have admitted that one suspect, Tamerlan Tsarnaev had been added to a terrorism database 18 months ago. The heat is also on the FBI who had been alerted to the threat posed by the same suspect, who died during the manhunt last week. The White House has come out in defence of their agencies. White House Press Secretary, Jay Carney answered questions on the case: “Tamerlan Tsarnaev did appear in our systems when he travelled, but we also know that the FBI did a thorough investigation in 2011 and did not find any terrorism activity foreign or domestic…What we learned from, in a warning from Russia, for example, and the action that sparked the FBI to look into Tamerlan Tsarnaev. All of these issues are obviously under investigation.” . Meanwhile surviving suspect, Dzhokar Tsarnaev, is being interrogated by a special FBI unit. He said the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq were what motivated them. He has been charged with conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction and could face a death sentence. This comes as unnamed officials told Associated Press that Dzhokar Tsarnaev,was unnarmed when he was arrested hiding inside a boat during the manhunt in Watertown. This contradicts Boston police claims that he had been involved in a firefight with officers before he was captured.
