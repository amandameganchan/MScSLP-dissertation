# ORIG CONTENT  Turkish police have broken up a violent mob in the port town of Iskenderun, after nationalist activists attacked three German soldiers. 28 protesters from the Turkish Union of Youth have been detained. The ultra-nationalist group is known for throwing bags over the heads of NATO forces. It carries out the practice in protest at an incident during the 2003-4 Iraq war, in which US forces captured and hooded Turkish soldiers. Ilker Yucel, leader of the Turkish Union of Youth, says: . “We will not allow foreign soldiers to walk freely in our country. We will continue to throw bags over soldiers. We just did and will continue to do so.” . Germany, the Netherlands and the United States are each sending two Patriot missile batteries and up to 400 troops to Turkey, following a request from Ankara. The reinforcements are intended to protect the country from potential attack by neighbouring Syria.
