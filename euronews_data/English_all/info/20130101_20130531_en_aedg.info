# ORIG TITLE    Poll boost for Germany’s Merkel as she gears up for third term bid . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The man hoping to become Germany’s next Chancellor is losing support. According to the latest opinion poll carried out by public television station ARD, Social Democrat politician Peer Steinbrück is down four points to 32 percent – the lowest rating for an SPD candidate since 2005. Steinbrück’s campaign for September’s election has been described by the German press as “miserable”. The poll shows German Chancellor Angela Merkel is the country’s most popular politician. Seeking a third term in September, her approval rating is 68 percent. The poll also shows, if Germans could vote for a Chancellor directly, 60 percent would choose the Christian Democrat. There has also been a positive response to pictures showing Merkel on holiday on the Italian island of Ischia at Easter. Although there is good news for the Chancellor, the overall mood in the country is not so cheerful. Three quarters of people polled said they thought the euro crisis would get worse for Germany.
