# ORIG CONTENT  A Twitter feud over how to handle the euro crisis has been set to music in what’s being described as a ‘financial opera’ titled Nostra Culpa or Our Fault. It is based on a series of dramatic tweets between the Estonian president Toomas Hendrik Ilves and the US Nobel Prize winning economist Paul Krugman. Latvian-born US composer Eugene Birman said: “The tweets and this entire text are so theatrical and so fantastically alive that it was very easy to set it to music. In that way it’s like really great poetry. There is so much drama, there is so much that is unsaid and because of that I found it very liberating to write a piece like this.” . The words for the 16 minute opera were written or edited by US journalist Scott Diel, who lives in Estonia. He said Nostra Culpa doesn’t take sides: “I’m not an economist but let’s say an informed reader, so the jury is still out for me. As far as who wins in the opera I think we have to let the reader decide, the listener decide.” . Economist Krugman expressed his doubts over Estonia’s success in dealing with the financial crisis, saying harsh austerity measures were not an economic triumph. The president responded with a series of increasingly hysterical tweets – which Krugman eventually ignored.
