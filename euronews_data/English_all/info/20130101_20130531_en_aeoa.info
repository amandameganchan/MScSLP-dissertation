# ORIG CONTENT  The ‘Great Revelation’ has begun as French politicians unveil their assets to the public with some rather surprising discoveries. Details began trickling in of millionaire ministers as the Monday deadline rang. The socialist Minister for Foreign Affairs Laurent Fabius has been singled out for scrutiny. He declared a personal fortune of over 6 million euros. His Parisian apartment is worth 2.5 million euros alone. Despite some MPs decrying the outing of personal wealth, others feel it just the beginning of the process to win back public trust. Agriculture Minister, Stephane Lefoll said it was “a necessary step but it’s not enough. We need to keep it up of course.” . Next up for scrutiny are MPs, heads of local government, cabinet, members of ministerial cabinets and directors of central administration. The exercise is an attempt by President Francois Hollande to save face after Finance Minister Jerome Cahuzac was named and shamed for having a secret Swiss bank account after repeatedly denying it.
