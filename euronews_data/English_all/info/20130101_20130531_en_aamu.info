# ORIG TITLE    Costa Concordia anniversary: Survivors return to Giglio . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Exactly one year after the Costa Concordia cruise liner tragedy, survivors and relatives of the 32 victims have gathered for a day-long commemoration off Italy’s Giglio island. At a ceremony, part of the large rock that tore a hole into the hull of the liner was returned to the sea. It had been lodged in the vessel since the ship capsized last January, with 4,200 passengers and crew onboard. The Concordia’s captain, Francesco Schettino, is likely to face multiple manslaughter charges. He has been criticised for abandoning ship before all the passengers had been evacuated. Commander Giovanni De Falco, who led the rescue operation, has been declared a hero after he ordered Schettino to return to his cruise liner on the night of the disaster. Speaking on Sunday, De Falco said: “We have to carry out our duties, whatever they may be, even when risk is involved. It is our duty to do everything that we can do, and it should be done with conviction.” . Schettino, who remains under house arrest, maintains he saved lives by bringing the ship closer to shore. Giglio residents joined relatives and survivors for a memorial mass in the island’s only church. On Sunday evening, at the exact moment a year ago the cruise ship struck the reef, there will be a minute’s silence for the victims. In what is likely to be an emotional moment for their relatives, boats anchored around the capsized vessel will sound their horns. “Today I couldn’t sleep quite well, because I have been constantly thinking, ‘It is going to be again, the same agony tonight’,” said Kevin Rebello, whose brother died in the tragedy. The Concordia is expected to be rolled upright and towed away by September.
