# ORIG TITLE    Armenia gets a second dose of Sarksyan . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Armenia’s central election commission has announced President Serzh Sarksyan has won a second five-year term. Exit polls when voting ended yesterday gave the incumbent 58% percent of the vote which the commission said was confirmed in preliminary results. “This election proved once again that our people are capable of uniting at the decisive moment, and making the right decision,” claimed the victor. International electoral observers gave the election a clean bill of health, noting it was an improvement on 2008, but criticised the “lack of competition” and the failure of politicians to “engage the public’s interest”. Police say there have been reports of 70 voting violations including bribery, and that two criminal investigations have been launched.
