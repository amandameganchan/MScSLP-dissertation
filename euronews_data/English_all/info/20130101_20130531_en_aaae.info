# ORIG TITLE    Ceremony to mark Fatah anniversary . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A formal ceremony has been held in Hebron, in the West Bank, to mark the 48th anniversary of the founding of the Fatah party. The largest group in the Palestinian Liberation Organisation was born on January 1 1964 as part of the struggle with Israel. The recent recognition of Palestine by the United Nations as a de-facto state has given many Palestinian officials renewed confidence in their ongoing fight. Azzam Al Ahmad, a PLO Central Committee member said the recognition has brought about new opportunities: “We will not overreact and abuse the rights that we obtained at the United nations.” . There were fireworks and street celebrations as several thousand supporters of Fatah gathered in Gaza. Permission was given by the party’s fierce opponents Hamas, who seized control of the strip in 2007. Relations between the two groups have been tense ever since but are improving.
