# ORIG TITLE    FIFA approves goal-line technology . 
# ORIG CONTENT  FIFA President Sepp Blatter said on Friday his organisation would have looked “foolish” had it failed to introduce goal-line technology ahead of the 2014 World Cup. Frank Lampard’s goal-that-never-was for England against Germany at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa sparked the 76 year old to back refereeing aides set to be launched this summer. As well as discussing goal-line technology, Blatter also added that match-fixing gave him cause for concern. At least 425 people from more than 15 countries are currently suspected of conspiring to fix hundreds of matches on behalf of Asian criminal syndicates that made millions of Euros in profits by betting on the results.
