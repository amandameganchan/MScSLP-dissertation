# ORIG TITLE    Giffords tells Congress to act now on gun violence . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The former US congresswoman, critically injured in a mass shooting two years ago, has told Congress to be “bold” and “courageous” in tackling gun violence. Gabby Giffords’ speech comes six weeks after the Sandy Hook massacre. “Speaking is difficult but I need to say something important. Violence is a big problem. Too many children are dying. Too many children. We must do something. It will be hard, but the time is now. You must act,” the 42-year-old told US politicians. Giffords was shot by a lone gunman in Tucson, Arizona in January 2011. Though she survived, she is left with mobility and speech problems. Responding to outrage following the latest mass shooting, President Barack Obama has asked Congress to pass the largest package of gun restrictions in decades. But America’s powerful pro-gun lobby thinks the proposals won’t work.
