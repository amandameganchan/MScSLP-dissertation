# ORIG TITLE    Departure of BOJ governor boosts Nikkei . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Japan’s stock exchange has closed at its highest level since September two thousand and eight. By closing, the Nikkei was up more than three percent in its best performance since the beginning of the global financial crisis. The strong performance comes off the back of news that the Bank of Japan’s governor will leave his job earlier than expected. Masaaki Shirakawa has announced that he will stand down about three weeks before the end of his five-year term at the helm of the country’s central bank. This clears the way for a new head whose approach will be more in line with the increase in quantitative easing advocated by Japan’s new prime minister Shinzo Abe.
