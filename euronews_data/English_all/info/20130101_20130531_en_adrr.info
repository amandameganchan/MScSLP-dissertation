# ORIG TITLE    UK: Cameron talks tough on immigration . 
# ORIG CONTENT  British Prime Minister David Cameron has unveiled a crackdown on immigration. The Conservative leader was addressing public concerns about Romanians and Bulgarians who will have the right to work in Britain from 2014. The prospect has led the right-leaning press to warn of a huge new wave of immigration, and fuelled the rise of the Euro-sceptic UK Independence Party (UKIP). Speaking to students at University Campus Suffolk in Ipswich, Cameron vowed to show illegal immigrants “the door” and said he would control the influx from Europe: . “Under this government, there will always be transitional controls introduced when a new country joins [the EU], as we’ve seen with Bulgaria and Romania, and as there will be when Croatia joins this year.” . Previously seen as a taboo and the preserve of racists, all three main parties now talk tough on immigration. Polls show this is one of UK voters main concerns ahead of the 2015 election, as they fear immigrants will abuse the country’s welfare System.
