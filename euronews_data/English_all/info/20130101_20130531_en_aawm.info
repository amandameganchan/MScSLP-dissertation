# ORIG TITLE    More flight disruption across Europe as heavy snow continues . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Freezing temperatures and heavy snow continue to batter parts of Europe, causing further travel chaos. At Frankfurt airport, 27% of flights have been cancelled after a bout of fresh snow following freezing rain on Monday. The airport operator said that ice-coatings on planes are too thick for normal de-icing work. At Paris’ Orly airport, the airport operator renewed the call to cut 40% of all inbound and outbound flights. Charles-de-Gaulle airport was similarly hit, with mostly short-haul services being affected. Meteo France has issued orange alerts for Paris and forecast up to 20 cms of snow. London’s Heathrow airport cancelled 10% of flights, with 130 flights cut from the schedule. Low visibility has forced the airport operator to allow more space between aircraft as a safety measure. Gatwick and Stansted fared better. Both airports are open and operational but expect to see some delays and flight cancellations.
