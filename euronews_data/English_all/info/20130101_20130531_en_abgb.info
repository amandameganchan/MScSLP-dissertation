# ORIG TITLE    Ukraine ex-policeman jailed for murder of journalist Gongadze . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A former Ukrainian police officer has been jailed for life for the murder of a campaigning journalist Georgiy Gongadze in 2000. General Oleksiy Pukach implied in court that others, including ex-President Leonid Kuchma, were equally guilty. A case against the former leader was dismissed two years ago. Gongadze wrote about political corruption and crime. The discovery of the 31-year-old’s headless body sparked a wave of public anger which eventually led to the “Orange Revolution”. His widow’s lawyer said she intended to appeal, arguing that the court has failed to determine the motives for the killing.
