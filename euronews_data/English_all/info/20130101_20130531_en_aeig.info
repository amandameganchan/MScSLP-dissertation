# ORIG TITLE    What will be the TV hits of 2014? . 
# ORIG CONTENT  What will be the next Mad Men or Walking Dead? The television shows that will – hopefully – grip people around the world over the next few years are being presented at the MIPTV forum in Cannes. Our reporter Giovanni Magi is there. He said: “Television is experiencing a moment of profound transformation, from economic, artistic and technological points of view. Cannes, where TV movers and shakers have been meeting for 50 years, is the ideal place to understand the future of television.” . With the plethora of platforms now available, productions must also take into account the economic climate. Jérôme Delhaye, Director of the Entertainment Division at Reed Midem, said: “Today the users and the viewer, people who watch telly, need more and more content, more often, and the screen itself is not important. How can we provide all this content? Plenty of creativity. And how to do we make it pay?How do we engage the audience? This is what we are thinking about, lots of players who come here with bags of creativity, these are either traditional TV players or people from the web. There are no longer barriers between the two because what’s important is creativity – content is king – as we say and I think it’s going to be that way for a very long time.” . MIPTV showcased several new channels available exclusively online – following in the footsteps of shows like YouTube’s science series VSauce. Founder Michael Stevens explained: “I think that there are a lot of recipes for success. I happen to know the explanatory and teaching people things recipe, but I think that really what it matters is that you listen to your audience. Right, they don’t just wanna be fans, they wanna be friends. When they subscribe your content and talk to their friends about content, they don’t you see you as a talent, they see you as a friend, someone that they’re connected to, someone that they wanna see their friends with.” . MIPTV is not only about buying and selling shows, it’s a chance to see some of the stars of the small screen at the Digital Emmy Awards.
