# ORIG TITLE    Pistorius in court for fourth day, bail decision due . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A judge at a court in Pretoria, South Africa is expected to decide on Friday whether to grant bail for champion paralympian Oscar Pistorius. The athlete known as the “Blade Runner”, whose legs were amputated when he was a child, is facing murder charges over the death of his girlfriend – model Reeva Steenkamp. Prosecutors argue that the global star is a cold-blooded killer – who fired four shots through a locked bathroom door while his girlfriend cowered on the other side in the early hours of Valentine’s Day. Pistorius’ lawyers – who maintain that he shot his girlfriend by mistake – say he deserves bail to prepare for his court case. The defence also says contradictory evidence given by a police detective has undermined the prosecution’s case.
