# ORIG TITLE    Libyan Coptic church suffers second attack . 
# ORIG CONTENT  For the second time in a week a Coptic Christian church in Benghazi, Libya, has been attacked. Police say they prevented the unidentified attackers from causing more serious damage. It appears the arsonists were angry about a protest in front of the Libyan embassy in Cairo, Egypt by Coptic Christians, who burned the Libyan flag. The attack comes a week after over some 100 Copts were arrested in Libya following accusations of them attempting to convert Muslims. One of the detainees, Ezzat Atallah, has died in prison in Tripoli. His family says he was tortured. It was his death in custody that sparked the Cairo flag-burning. A French newspaper says the Copts will be released soon, but this has not been confirmed by the Libyan authorities.
