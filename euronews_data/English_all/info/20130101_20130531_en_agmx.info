# ORIG TITLE    The Hangover finally gets sober . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Moving away from the amnesiac-mystery device that anchored their previous two outings, ‘Hangover III’ is the final film in the comedy franchise which has made such beloved stars out of its cast. For Director and co-writer, Todd Phillips, the friendships made will outlast the series’ production: “The last day of shooting was actually really joyous and really sweet. We have been together for five or six years and we really love each other. The group for real and it’s weird. The truth is it wasn’t that sad because three days later I was with Ed Helms and Bradley Cooper in Paris for New Years Eve. We just hang out together all the time.” . Having said this, it seems the trilogy’s onus on intimate bonding trials has made saying goodbye difficult. Not least for its lead, Bradley Cooper: “It is kind of bittersweet. When we started at the press junket in Las Vegas we all were shocked at how emotional it is. This ending of the road. It is nice that we have this two week tour to ritualistically say good bye.” . Returning to Vegas, where it all began for the Hungover triplet, this latest installment also stars Melissa McCarthy and John Goodman. For Heather Graham, who plays Ed Helms’ first wife in the film, its still all about the boys: “Well it is kind of a bromance isn’t it? It is a friendship story yeah. I mean you got the crazy friend, the kind of manly friend, and the nerdy friend. It is kind of about friendship bonding.” . Going to much darker, more dangerous, emotional and artistic places than its predecessors, ‘Hangover III’ dares to alienate the very audience that made ‘The Hangover’ the highest grossing comedy of all time.
