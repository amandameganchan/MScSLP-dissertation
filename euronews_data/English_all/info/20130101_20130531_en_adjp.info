# ORIG CONTENT  The Federal Reserve is to press ahead with its aggressive stimulus programme despite improving US economic conditions. Wrapping up a two-day meeting, the central bank’s chief .. Ben Bernanke and fellow policy makers said they will continue large-scale purchases of government bonds – injecting 85 billion dollars a month into the economy. With the latest flare-up in the eurozone crisis serving as a timely reminder of a risky global economic environment, the Fed said despite a return to moderate growth US unemployment remains too high and expressed concern about recent spending cuts in Washington. “The committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labour market has improved substantially in a context of price stability,” the US central bank said. The Fed also released a new set of economic forecasts that may surprise some market analysts, who had predicted solid recent data might lead to upgrades in policymakers’ views. Fed officials now see growth in a range of 2.3-2.8 percent in 2013, down from 2.3-3.0 percent in its December projections. For 2014, the Fed sees US GDP expanding 2.9-3.4 percent versus 3.0-3.5 percent in December. The Fed now believes the jobless rate, which registered 7.7 percent in February, will average 7.3-7.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013, down from 7.4-7.7 percent in December. Unemployment will not fall to 6.5 percent, the level at which central bankers have suggested they will begin to consider raising rates, until 2015, the estimates show.
