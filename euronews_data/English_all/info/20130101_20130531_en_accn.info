# ORIG TITLE    Nigeria kidnapping: hostage photo shown on TV . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The first photo has emerged purporting to show some of the seven foreigners who have been kidnapped in northern Nigeria. The image, showing a group of blurred faces, was shown on Nigerian TV. Euronews cannot independently verify the picture. Four Europeans employed by a Lebanese construction firm were among those believed to have been taken by Islamist extremists on Saturday. Nigerian authorities say the workers are from the UK, Greece, Italy, Lebanon and the Philippines. Britain has yet to confirm whether one of the hostages was one of its own nationals. Gunmen stormed a workers’ camp in the town of Jama’are in Bauchi state and a guard was shot dead as the foreigners were removed. On Monday, the Islamist group Ansaru has claimed responsibility for the raid. It’s the worst foreign kidnap case in northern Nigeria since an Islamist insurgency by Boko Haram and other groups intensified nearly two years ago.
