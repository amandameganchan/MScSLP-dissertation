# ORIG CONTENT  Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak has hinted his country was behind an air strike on a Syrian arms complex close to the Lebanese border last Wednesday. US officials suggest the attack hit a convoy that contained weapons bound for Hezbollah in Lebanon. Syria denies any such claims and said Israeli bombs hit a military research centre. Danny Ayalon is the Israeli deputy foreign minister: . “Israel has the right to self-defence, we have an obligation to defend our population. Unfortunately, we are seeing a rampant radicalisation in the region and what has been called the ‘Arab Spring’ is becoming an islamist winter and much of it is attributed to the Ayatollahs in Tehran.” . In Damascus President Assad held talks with Saeed Jalili head of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council. Assad said Israel, “in collaboration with foreign enemy forces and their agents on Syrian soil were trying to destabilise and weaken Syria.” . Syria’s ambassador to Lebanon warned that his country may take a “surprise decision to respond.” .
