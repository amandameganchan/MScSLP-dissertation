# ORIG TITLE    African Union accuses ICC of race hunt against Africans . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The African Union has publicly accused the International Criminal Court of ‘ hunting’ Africans because of their race. The accusation was made as the AU summit drew to a close in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa. African leaders oppose the ICC’s pursuit of Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Rutu on charges of crimes against humanity. Ethiopian Prime Minister and AU chairperson Haile Mariam Desalegn made the allegation in his closing address: . “The process ICC is conducting in Africa has a flaw. The intention was to avoid any kind of impunity and ill governance and crime, but now the process has degenerated into some kind of race hunting.” . The ICC insists that it is an impartial body and is determined to continue with its case against President Kenyatta and others in Africa. Former Ivory Coast President Laurent Gbagbo is currently on trial and another ICC target Sudan President Omar al-Bashir defied an international arrest warrant to attend the summit in Addis . The ICC has charged Bashir with genocide over the conflict in Dafur.
