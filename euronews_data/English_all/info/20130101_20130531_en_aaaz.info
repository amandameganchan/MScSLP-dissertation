# ORIG CONTENT  Families of the victims of a stampede at a New Year’s Eve fireworks display in Ivory Coast are demanding to know how the tragedy could have killed so many. Sixty-two people died and scores more were injured in the crush as people were leaving the event in the commercial capital Abidjan. Several victims were young children. The media was quick to blame security at the football stadium and called for the event organisers to be prosecuted. Some editors said parents were irresponsible for letting young children watch fireworks in the middle of a huge crowd, late at night. One local resident said: “We need an investigation to find out exactly what happened; and when we know who’s at fault, we need to take a decision and punishment should be handed out.” . President Alassane Ouattara and his wife visited several of the injured in hospital as three days of national mourning began. He has promised a full investigation.
