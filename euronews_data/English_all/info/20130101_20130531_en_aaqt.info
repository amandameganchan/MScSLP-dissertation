# ORIG CONTENT  Italy’s former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi has launched a scathing attack on leading European parliamentarians within his own centre-right bloc. It comes as polls show his centre-right coalition is making rapid gains ahead of next month’s elections. In an exclusive interview with euronews the head of Italy’s opposition People of Freedom criticises the European People’s Party leader Joseph Daul for backing his rival Mario Monti. Berlusconi believes the EPP’s support for Mario Monti is based on him wanting closer ties with Berlin. “Daul is just one of the EPP’s 14 deputy presidents. Maybe he has a personal ambitions. Don’t forget he speaks German better than French, because he is from Strasbourg. He just wants to be somebody to give a boost to his political carreer,” said Berlusconi. He also dismissed claims of having personal issues with other prominent MEPs such as Martin Schulz and Jean-Claude Juncker. “I’m sorry but these people are nobody’s in Europe,” he added. The full interview can be seen from 1930CET on Thursday.
