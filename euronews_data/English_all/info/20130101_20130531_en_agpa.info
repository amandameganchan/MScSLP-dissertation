# ORIG TITLE    Serena storms past French wildcard into French Open third round . 
# ORIG CONTENT  World number one Serena Williams roared into the third round of the French Open with a straight set demolition of French wildcard Caroline Garcia. Williams came into the tie on a career-best 25 match winning streak and wrapped up the opening set in less than half an hour. Garcia offered a bit more resistance in the second but was still no match for the 15-times grand slam champion. Williams now faces Romania’s Sorana Cirstea in the third round. Elsewhere, last year’s beaten finalist Sara Errani also had a comfortable 6-1, 6-1 victory over Yulia Putintseva while fourth seed Agnieszka Radwanska saw off American Mallory Burdette 6-3 6-2. Former champion Ana Ivanovic, seeded 14, beat Frenchwoman Mathilde Johansson. In the men’s competition Roger Federer was in no mood to hang about as he demolished India’s Somdev Devvarman in a hopelessly one-sided match. The Swiss, who is chasing a second French Open title, was never put under any pressure and ruthlessly dispatched of his 188th-ranked opponent. Federer now faces France’s Julien Benneteau who beat him in Rotterdam in February and pushed him hard in a five-setter at Wimbledon last year. Crowd favourites Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Gael Monfils lived up to their flamboyant billings as they progressed into the third round in lively fashion at the expense of Jarkko Nieminen and Ernests Gulbis.
