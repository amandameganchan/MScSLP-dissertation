# ORIG TITLE    No rights fight between Liberty and BSkyB . 
# ORIG CONTENT  US firm Liberty Global has said it is not going to get into bidding wars for content with Rupert Murdoch’s BSkyB once it owns British cable TV group Virgin Media. Liberty Global’s billionaire owner John Malone is buying Virgin – Britain’s second largest pay-TV provider – for 11.6 billion euros. That pits him against old rival Murdoch, who’s BSkyB satellite group is the biggest in the UK. Malone and Murdoch went head-to-head a decade ago over control of DirecTV, the largest US satellite TV broadcaster. Liberty Global said it will share content and avoid battling with BSkyB over right for expensive things like England’s Premier League football. It also said it is not planning any major expansion of Virgin’s cable network.
