# ORIG TITLE    Fear and anger in southeast London after murder of British soldier . 
# ORIG CONTENT  On the streets of Woolwich in south-east London, a heavy police presence remains after the brutal murder of a British soldier in broad daylight on Wednesday. Locals fear the repercussions of the events for their communities as terrorism and Islamist extremism are back in the UK spotlight. Reactions range from fear to anger. “As it is for the black community we are really, really angry about it. We got harboured by the English people so they don’t deserve this, they don’t deserve it. So what those boys did is way, way beyond anything one could explain,” said one resident of Nigerian descent. Another resident said the situation was ‘quite tense’. “A few of my colleagues were scared to come to work today because it was right on the doorstep,” she explained. Police hoped to allay any tensions from arising following clashes with members of the right wing English Defence League (EDL) in the capital on Wednesday. Security at Woolwich Barracks has also been stepped up.
