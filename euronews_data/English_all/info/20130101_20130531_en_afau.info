# ORIG CONTENT  Days after the collapse of a building in Bangladesh, the death toll continues to rise. The building, which houses factories producing low-cost clothes for Western retailers, including Britain’s Primark, was reduced to rubble on Wednesday. 273 people have now been confirmed dead, but many are still searching in hope for friends and family. A combined rescue operation from Bangladesh’s army, navy and air force have battled to reach survivors among the twisted metal and debris, using their bare hands and mechanical equipment. Officials said they are not sure how many still remain trapped, but that priority has now been given to save those still alive. Up to 2,000 have been rescued so far, but as many as 1,000 people still remain unaccounted for in what is to date, the country’s worst industrial accident. As rescuers struggle to reach as many as possible, the disaster will focus attention on the global links between Western company profits and potential compromises in safety for workers in developing countries.
