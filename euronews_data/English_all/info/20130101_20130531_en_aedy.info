# ORIG TITLE    Morning-after pill ruling causes controversy in the United States . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A federal judge in the United States has ordered the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to make the “morning after” emergency contraceptive pill available without a prescription to all girls of reproductive age. Reproductive- rights groups welcomed the decision while anti-abortion and some religious groups criticised it. The White House Press Secretary Jay Carney has said that U.S. President Barack Obama supported more restrictive controls. The saga over the pill known as “Plan B” has caused political and religious debate for many years and this ruling to liberalise its sale reverses a decision in 2011 by the U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary, Kathleen Sebelius.
