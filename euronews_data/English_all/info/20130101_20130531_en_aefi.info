# ORIG TITLE    Europe’s elder statesmen pay homage to Thatcher . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A woman of her word and a woman who always perfectly presented – just some of the memories of Valery Giscard d’Estaing. Margaret Thatcher was like a sparring partner for France’s former president in her early years as prime minister and he says she left a lasting impression. “She had an unwavering strength. A special indomitable character – which is why she was called the Iron Lady. She didn’t have much time for interlocutors because she thought they were weaker than her,” he said. For Germany’s former Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Thatcher was a “great woman” who earned your respect, “even if you disagreed” with her. He said she was one of the most exceptionally gifted prime ministers Britain ever had. “There was no substitute for her. I’m full of respect and awe for our mutual past,” said Kohl. Mikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union, said she was a “great politician and an exceptional person” who helped end the Cold War. Flags at British embassies around the world will fly at half mast while the British parliament will be recalled from its Easter recess on Wednesday to enable MPs to pay tributes.
