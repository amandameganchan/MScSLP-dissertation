# ORIG TITLE    Brazilian city embeds QR codes into pavements . 
# ORIG CONTENT  QR or Quick Response codes are being embedded into pavements on Ipanema beach and all over Rio de Janeiro. Craftsmen are using the same types of black and white stones that already decorate many streets to create the mosaic bar codes. They can be scanned with a mobile device to reveal more information about Brazil’s second largest city. Specialist stone craftsmen were picked, with extensive experience creating pavements out of mosaic materials. Gediao Jorge was one of them: “It was a challenge. I’ve built Portuguese pavements like these for 27 years now, but this was the biggest challenge of my career.” . Officials plan to install 30 paved QR codes to allow Rio’s two million annual tourists to be better informed about what the city has to offer.
