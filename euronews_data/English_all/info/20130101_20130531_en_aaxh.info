# ORIG CONTENT  Dutch international Wesley Sneijder has completed his move from Inter Milan to Galatasaray for a fee of â‚¬7.5million after passing a club medical at an Istanbul hospital on Tuesday. The 28 year old, who signed a three-year deal with the Turkish champions, inspired the Nerazzuri to an unprecedented Champions League, Serie A and Italian Cup treble in 2010 before helping the Netherlands finish World Cup runners-up in South Africa. Sneijder made only six appearances for Inter Milan this season and despite his lack of playing time, the Dutch playmaker could make his Galatasaray debut at home to city rivals Besiktas on Sunday.
