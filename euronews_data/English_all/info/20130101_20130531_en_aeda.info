# ORIG TITLE    ‘Wanted’ for $1 million: pig-faced N Korea leader Kim Jong-un . 
# ORIG CONTENT  North Korea leader Kim Jong-Un has been attacked – not diplomatically or with nuclear weapons, but in cyberspace. The country’s official uriminzokkri Twitter and Flickr accounts have been hacked. Instead of the usual praise for the young leader the Twitter account now reads ‘Hacked’ and is even linked to photosharing site Flickr, where a mocked up ‘Wanted’ picture shows Kim Jong-Un with pig’s features and offers a bounty of one million US dollars. Hacker activist group Anonymous claim to be behind the attacks and their logo has appeared on the North Korean Flickr site. Anonymous has hacked sites belonging to governments all over the world.
