# ORIG CONTENT  Thousands gathered at an airport in Turkey to pay tribute to three Kurdish activists killed in Paris. The women, who worked for the separatist PKK, were shot dead in what police describe as an “execution-style” attack last week. The plane carrying their bodies arrived at Diyarbakir, the largest city in the mainly Kurdish south east of the country. The city’s mayor led the tributes; “Everyone in Diyarbakir, young and old, we all feel the same- We have taken these women to our hearts. And while embracing these three lives, we embrace peace and hope.” . Meanwhile, in Iraq, Turkish jets are reportedly bombing Kurdish targets for the third day running. Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan says anti-PKK operations will continue until the Kurdish militants lay down their weapons. Officials also say Turkish security forces will also be monitoring any demonstrations by the Kurdish minority in support of the slain activists.
