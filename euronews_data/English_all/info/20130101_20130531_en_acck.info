# ORIG TITLE    Correa re-elected as Ecuador president . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Crowds gathered at the presidential palace in Quito on Sunday night to celebrate the re-election of Ecuadorean president Rafael Correa. The left-wing leader took nearly 57 percent of the vote to claim his third term, avoiding a runoff. Ecuador’s election authority said although only 40 percent of the vote had been counted, they didn’t expect the figures to change significantly. Correa has been credited with a drastic reduction in poverty through ambitious but expensive public sector projects. In a victory speech meant to unify the country, Correa said: “I am grateful to the people of Ecuador, to the legions of men and women that trusted in us. And to those who didn’t vote for us, we are the government of all the people, we’re going to serve you, all of you, with care and compromise.” . His closest challenger, Guillermo Lasso won less than half of Correa’s figure. Lasso’s promise of tax cuts weren’t enough and the win for Correa means he’s likely to continue his popularist policies that include liberally spending the country’s oil revenues.
