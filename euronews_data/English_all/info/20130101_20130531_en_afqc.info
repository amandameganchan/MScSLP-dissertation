# ORIG CONTENT  Recent weeks have seen a certain political tension between Russia’s President Putin and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev – but differences were put aside as they appeared together at this year’s Red Square Parade in Moscow. World War II veterans were also there to mark the 68th anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany, commemorated the day after the rest of Europe because of the time difference when the capitulation was signed. The defence minister oversaw drills that have been months in preparation. More than 11,000 military personnel took part in the parade. During his time in power, Vladimir Putin has expanded the celebrations and the military hardware on display. The president has announced plans to spend hundreds of billions of euros to modernise Russia’s military. After a lull in the 1990s, Victory Day is now as strong as ever in Russia. All over the country other events are taking place – 1,500 in the capital alone. To mark 68 years, 68 military planes and helicopters filled the Moscow sky for a spectacular finale.
