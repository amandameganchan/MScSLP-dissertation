# ORIG TITLE    Drama at Cannes – but this time off the red carpet . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A touch of drama came to the Cannes Film Festival in an unexpected guise on Friday night when a man disrupted a live television broadcast by firing a starting pistol. Predictably security was then stepped up and the man arrested but not before the whole incident had sent everyone running for cover. But in true showbiz spirit the glitz and the glamour and of course the competition for the coveted Palme d’Or had to go on. Keeping his mind on the movies, our reporter Fred Ponsard said: . “Two new films have been shown to the jury and to the public. The very dark and violent “A Touch of Sin” by Chinese director Jia Zhang-Ke and the long awaited “ The Past “, shot in France by Iranian director Ashgar Farhadi . These screenings have been very well received and may have already thrown up a serious contender for the Palme d’Or.” . Unlike his previous films Academy Award-winning director Asghar Farhardi shot “The Past” outside his native Iran. The film is a tale of domestic upheaval set in and around Paris. While Jia Zhangke’s “A Touch of Sin” is a no holds barred tale of violent crime and corruption.
