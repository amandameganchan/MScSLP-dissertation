# ORIG CONTENT  Security officials say a drone strike has killed the second-in-command of the Pakistani Taliban. Wali-ur-Rehman is thought to be among seven who died. If true, his death would be a major blow to the organisation, depriving the group of its chief military strategist. Eyewitnesses in the northwestern region say the drone fired two missiles that hit a house. It is the first strike for six weeks, and is the first reported drone strike since President Barack Obama last week announced tighter scrutiny for his US drone programme. Drone attacks have become a regular occurrence in the region over the last seven years. Pakistan’s foreign ministry has repeatedly denounced drones. Prime Minister-elect Nawaz Sharif has described them as a challenge to his country’s sovereignty.
