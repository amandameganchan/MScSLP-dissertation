# ORIG TITLE    Lincoln leads the Oscar pack . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The build up is underway and it started earlier than usual. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has announced the Oscar nominations ahead of the annual awards ceremony on February 24. The short list for this year’s awards comes two weeks earlier than usual, that was designed to give people more time to see the nominated films. Movies like the US Presidential drama ‘Lincoln’. The historical movie dominated the race for the world’s top film honours with 12 nominations which include, Best Picture, Daniel Day Lewis as Best Actor with Tommy Lee Jones and Sally Field on the list for their supporting roles. Eight other movies have been given the nod for best picture including the ‘Life of Pi’. Many thought it would be impossible to adapt Yann Martel’s fantasy adventure novel for the silver screen. It was just behind Lincoln with 11 nominations. The short list is selected by a ballot of 6,000 members of the Academy.
