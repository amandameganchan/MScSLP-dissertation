# ORIG CONTENT  Chinese tourists have overtaken Germans as the world’s biggest-spending travelers. The United Nations World Tourism Organisation said that follows a decade of robust growth in the number of Chinese holidaying abroad. Known for using organised tours and snapping up luxury items while travelling, they spent 41 percent more on foreign travel in 2012 than the year before. That added up to 78 billion euros, outstripping the Germans and the Americans who managed 64 billion for each country’s travellers. Britons and Russians completed the top five spending 40 billion and 33 billion euros respectively. Thanks to rising disposable incomes, China is now the world’s fastest growing tourist source market. Plenty do come to Europe, but their favorite destinations remain Hong Kong, Taiwan and the Maldives. The German Travel Association (DRV) . said it was to be expected that the Chinese would eventually overtake Germans in terms of spending, given that the country had more inhabitants than North America, Russia and Europe put together. “But that they have overtaken us already is astonishing,” DRV president Juergen Buechy said.
