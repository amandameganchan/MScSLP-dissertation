# ORIG TITLE    China: Wife of jailed Nobel laureate says brothers trial is harassment . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The wife of jailed Chinese Nobel Peace laureate Liu Xiaobo has appeared in public to attend the trial of her brother accused of fraud. Liu Xia has been under house arrest since her husband was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010. Her brother Liu Hui has been in custody since January over a real estate deal . His lawyer believes the charges have no foundation. He faces a possible ten-year jail sentence if convicted. Liu Xia is convinced her brother’s trial is harassment: “I am certain his arrest is connected to me. They arrested him because they want to break my legs, first one then the other. But I will stand straight, I am not afraid,” she said outside the court in Beijing. Many see the trial as a typical Communist tactic of intimidating the families of known political activists. Liu Xiaobo was jailed in 2009 for helping to draft a manifesto called Charter 08, which demanded political change. Supporters of the family say Liu Xia’s house arrest has absolutely no legal basis and she has broken no law.
