# ORIG TITLE    Raul Castro to step down in 2018 . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Cuban President Raul Castro has announced he will step down from power after his second term ends in 2018. He made the announcement at a meeting of the country’s national assembly in Havana. 81-year-old Raul, who replaced his brother Fidel as president in 2008, has repeatedly said leaders should hold office for no more than two five-year terms. Miguel Diaz-Canal has been named first vice president. He is considered the most visible possible successor to Castro. Former President Fidel joined the National Assembly meeting on Sunday, a rare public appearance. The new government will almost certainly be the last headed up by the Castro brothers and their generation of leaders who have governed the country since the revolution in 1959. The 2011 party summit adopted a 300-point plan to update Cuba’s Soviet-style economic system. Minor manufacturing and retail have been encouraged and the country has opened up to some foreign investment.
