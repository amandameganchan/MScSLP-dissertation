# ORIG CONTENT  Eight storeys reduced to rubble in an instant. The Rana Plaza complex in Dhaka, Bangladesh collapsed during the morning rush hour. Housing a garment factory, a bank and many shops, one fireman said as many as 2,000 were inside at the time. Survivors speak about the moment the building folded like a house of cards. “At first the building shook and when we tried to leave the man who was standing at the gate stopped us and told us nothing had happened, don’t go outside. Hundreds of my co-workers were stuck in the building,” recalls garment worker, Monir Hussain. “I started my work at 8am this morning, at about 9.30 I suddenly heard a strange sound and I saw that the building was collapsing. I then ran out through a stairwell and jumped down,” says survivor Jaweel Islam. As relatives searched for their loved ones among the dead, questions are now being asked about the building’s safety following reports of a crack on Tuesday. Home Minister Muhiuddin Khan Alamgir vowed that the culprits would be punished.
