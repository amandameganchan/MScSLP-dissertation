# ORIG TITLE    Super Bowl: Friendly rivalry . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The Baltimore Ravens trained on Wednesday as they continue preparations to square off against the San Francisco 49ers in the 47th edition of the Super Bowl in New Orleans. Baltimore boss John Harbaugh told journalists that he will be focused on his team and not on their rivals who happen to be coached by his younger brother Jim. Ten days before playing the final game of his illustrious career, Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis said he was too busy to become sentimental and added he was looking forward to his final outing. The Ravens are playing in their first Super Bowl since winning their only Lombardi Trophy following the 2000 season while the 49ers will appear in their first in 18 years. The game kicks off on February 3.
