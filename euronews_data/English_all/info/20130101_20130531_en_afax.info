# ORIG CONTENT  The president of Corsica’s national park, Jean-Luc Chiappini has been assassinated. The 65-year-old was reportedly shot dead by the passenger of a high-powered motorcycle as he drove his car from the island’s main airport to the centre of town. He is the third prominent public figure to be murdered on the French Mediterranean island in the space of six months. Top lawyer Antoine Sollacaro and the president of southern Corsica’s chamber of commerce, Jacques Nacer were also killed in similar execution-style hits on October 16 and November 15, 2012 respectively. The island of around 300,000 people now has the highest murder rate in Europe. Though most of these murders remain unsolved, Corsican police believe they are connected with feuds between rival criminal gangs which have ties to the island’s nationalist movement.
