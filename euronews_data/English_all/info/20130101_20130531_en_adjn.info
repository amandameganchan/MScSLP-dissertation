# ORIG CONTENT  Washington says a war crimes suspect from the Democratic Republic of Congo has handed himself over to the US embassy in Kigali. Officials say General Bosco Ntaganda, who goes by the nickname “The Terminator”, has asked to be transferred to the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. Neither the US nor Rwanda recognise the ICC. Eastern DR Congo has been torn by conflict since 1994 when ethnic Hutu groups, accused of perpetrating the genocide in neighbouring Rwanda, fled over the border. It is unclear why Ntaganda chose to give himself up. He may have been left in a more vulnerable position since his rebel M23 movement split into rival factions earlier this month. A close ally was also detained by Rwandan authorities a few days ago.
