# ORIG TITLE    Obama rouses the congregation at Boston memorial service . 
# ORIG CONTENT  To heal the wounds of the Marathon bombing an interfaith service has been held at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross in Boston, attended by President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle, Mitt Romney, and the Governor of Massachusetts, Deval Patrick. People queued for 10 blocks around the building to try and get in to the service, which was by invitation only, to honour the three people killed and 176 injured by the two nail bombs. Cardinal Sean O’Malley conveyed commiserations from Pope Francis, and was just one of eight religious speakers. He also gave the blessing at the end of the service. Yo-Yo Ma played cello and choirs sang. President Obama delivered a moving reflection in honour of the victims which included a stirring call to arms. “They sought to intimidate us, to terrorise us, to shake us from those values that Deval described that make us who we are as Americans; Well it should be pretty clear by now that they picked the wrong city to do it – Not here in Boston! Not Here in Boston,” he said to applause.
