# ORIG TITLE    China’s new president tours Africa to boost trade and investment . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Chinese president Xi Jinping has begun his tour of Africa in Tanzania, as he hopes to bolster trade relations between the continent and China. Ties between the two countries have been strong since the Chinese built the Tanzania-Zambia Railway in the 1970s. Xi has already signed 16 agreements, including improvements to Tanzania’s hospitals and ports. Xi took office on 14 March and this is first official overseas trip, highlighting the importance of relations with the continent. He will also visit South Africa and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The tour comes as some in Africa are starting to question whether China, the world’s second biggest economy, is over-exploiting the continent’s natural resources such as oil and minerals. Trade between China and Africa is worth more than 150 billion euros. It is thought that China has invested more than 15 billion euros in Africa, more than double the 2007 total. African nations have welcomed the money, which does not come with the conditions set by the West, such as stamping out corruption, democratic reforms and poverty reduction.
