# ORIG CONTENT  Toyota, the worldâ€™s best-selling carmaker, is celebrating higher than expected profits in the three months to March. Aided by the weak yen, the firm has exceeded the 2.3 billion euro target set by its President Akio Toyoda two years ago, and it still has a five percent margin. Toyota foresees even higher earnings this year and could become the first carmaker in history to sell more than 10 million vehicles in a year.
