# ORIG TITLE    Militants attack French mine and army barracks in Niger . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Islamist suicide bombers have struck at an army barracks and a French-run uranium mine in Niger. In Agadez in the north, at least 20 soldiers were killed and 16 others injured when the bombers attacked at dawn. In Arlit, one person died and several others were injured in a car bomb attack at a uranium mine operated by the French nuclear group Areva. A West African offshoot of al-Qaedaâ€™s north African wing has claimed responsibility. The group was part of a loose Islamist coalition which seized control of neighbouring north Mali last year before being ousted by a French-led offensive in January.
