# ORIG TITLE    Premier League to introduce goalline technology . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Disputes over whether or not the ball has crossed the line in English Premier League matches will be a thing of the past starting next season. All 20 English topflight clubs on Thursday voted to approve the British Hawkeye goalline technology which involves several camera’s behind each goal. The vote to go ahead with the technology next season in England comes a week after FIFA announced that GoalControl, a camera-based system from Germany, would be used at this year’s Confederations Cup in Brazil and, if successful, would be implemented at the 2014 World Cup also in Brazil. Managing director of Hawkeye Steven Carter said: ‘‘Within tennis and cricket the motion of the ball it follows a parabola because it’s been hit and it’s travelling through the air. Whereas within football obviously the goalkeeper can carry it over the line obviously, it can be obscured and the motion is a lot more chaotic so whilst it is the same basic principles we’ve done a huge amount of research and development in making sure the system is absolutely right for football.” . The English Premier League will be the first domestic league to adopt goalline technology while Spain’s la Liga are reportedly keen to follow suit within three to four years. Although unconfirmed, Hawkeye’s debut appearance on English turf could even be at the pre-season Community Shield at Wembley after the Football Association sanctioning its testing at an England v Belgium international friendly last June.
