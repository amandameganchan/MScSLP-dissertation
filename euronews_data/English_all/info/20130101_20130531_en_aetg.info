The group, which included four children, was seized in February while on holiday. Gunmen claiming to be from the Nigerian Islamist group Boko Haram later released a video and threatened to kill the hostages if their demands were not met. The family was abducted by a group of armed men on motorcycles in Dabanga, around ten kilometres from the Nigerian border. The group was on holiday in the Waza national park. The hostage-takers threatened to kill their captives if the authorities in Nigeria and Cameroon did not release Muslim militants being held there.
