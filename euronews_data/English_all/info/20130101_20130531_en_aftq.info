# ORIG TITLE    Olympiacos retain Euroleague title . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Olympiacos became only the fourth club in the Final Four era to win back-to-back Euroleague titles after beating Real Madrid in the final at the O2 Arena in London on Sunday. It was the nine-times European champions from Madrid who got off to the better start and were leading by as many as 17 points by the end of the first quarter. But the Greek champions, in typical gutsy fashion, slowly but surely clawed themselves back into the showpiece match with the competition’s MVP Vassilis Spanoulis leading the charge with 21 points – all in the second half. Acie Law chipped in with 20 points and 5 assists while Kyle Hines added 12 points as the Greeks dominated the final 10 minutes to eventually see out a comfortable 100-88 victory. It is the third continental crown for the Greek heavyweights after last season’s triumph against CSKA Moscow and the 1997 title game when they beat Barcelona.
