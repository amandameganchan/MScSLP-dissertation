# ORIG TITLE    Gillard to stay on as Australian Labour party leader . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard has won an unopposed vote at a special meeting of the ruling Labour party, despite her party’s slump in opinion polls. The former elected prime minister she shunted aside, Kevin Rudd, failed to gather enough support in his third clash with Gillard since 2010. Polls say Labour faces a heavy defeat in September elections. “I accept the continuing support of me as Prime Minister and Labour leader with a sense of deep humility and a sense of resolve,” she said in a brief statement. Gillard is Australia’s first female leader but electors have never felt comfortable with the way she elbowed aside the elected Rudd. Despite helping keep Australia out of recession and maintaining growth, she and Labour, despite having similar policies, may be unable to hold off the Conservative challenge in September.
