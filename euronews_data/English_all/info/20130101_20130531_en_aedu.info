# ORIG TITLE    Tammam Salam overwhelmingly chosen as new Lebanon PM . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Following in the footsteps of his father, Tammam Salam has become the new prime minister of Lebanon. The Sunni Muslim former culture minister is seen as a centrist with alliances across the political spectrum. His father Saeb Salam served as prime minister six times between 1952 and 1973. After two days of parliamentary consultation, Tammam Salam was overwhelmingly chosen for the post. Lebanese television station LBCI reports 124 out the 128 lawmakers voted for him. Salam is close to the Saudi and Western-backed March 14 coalition – a group of political parties and independent politicians who are anti-Syria. March 14 is led by Saad Hariri, the son of assassinated former prime minister Rafik Hariri. Salam is also supported by the March 8 bloc, which includes the Iranian-backed Shi’ite Hezbollah. The new prime minister will now have to work on putting together a cabinet from the rival political groups.
