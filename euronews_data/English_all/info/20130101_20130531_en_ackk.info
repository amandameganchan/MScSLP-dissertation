# ORIG TITLE    “Argo” Best Picture causes ruffles in Iran . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Central Tehran seems a world away from the pomp and ceremony of the red carpet in Los Angeles. But this year, there is a common thread. The hostage rescue thriller “Argo”, took the Oscar for Best Picture. It is set in Iran, but not everyone is a fan. One newspaper is running the headline, “A response to historical distortions by the film Argo” . Amirkhani lives in Tehran and told euronews: “I didn’t watch the whole of ‘Argo.’ The film wasn’t appealing enough to make me watch the rest, I just couldn’t stand it. My feeling is that they awarded the Oscar to ‘Argo’ because of political or other reasons (rather than artistic ones). I believe this prize was neither for the film’s structure nor even its scenario.” . Art student Roham Razavi held a slightly different view: “Speaking of political motives behind the award, in fact, I don’t believe that the Oscars would do such a thing, I don’t know. They simply judged and awarded the first prize to ‘Argo.’” . Directed by Ben Affleck, who also acts in the film, “Argo” beat “Lincoln” to the top prize, which stars British born Daniel Day-Lewis. First Lady Michelle Obama and Jack Nicholson presented the best picture prize for “Argo” live from the White House.
