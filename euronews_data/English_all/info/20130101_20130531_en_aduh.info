# ORIG TITLE    Renault jobs boost for Spain . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Some good employment news for Spain as French car manufacturer Renault announced it is to create 700 new jobs in the country. Six hundred will be at its Valladolid factory where most of the posts will be part of a second shift for the production of its new ‘Capture’ model. A further 100 workers will also be hired at its Seville plant. But at the same time Renault’s Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn was downbeat about sales in Europe. Speaking at the New York auto show, Ghosn said Renault was planning for no growth in the market through 2016, with sales stabilising at best. He said industry sales are tracking to be down 10 percent in the first quarter, but reiterated that he sees them down three percent to five percent for the full year. Earlier this month Renault won agreement from unions for a deal on pay and conditions in France that it said would boost its competitiveness. Renault aims to cut 7,500 posts in France by 2016 mainly through natural turnover, equivalent to 14 percent of French staff, and wants to freeze salaries in 2013, win flexibility to switch workers between sites and lengthen average working hours by 6.5 percent.
