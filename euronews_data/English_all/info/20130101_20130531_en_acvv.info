# ORIG CONTENT  Italian police are investigating an apparent suicide of the spokesman for the world’s oldest bank, Monte dei Paschi di Siena. It follows the discovery of David Rossi’s body beneath a window at the firm’s 14th Century headquarters. Rossi was among several MPS staff members whose homes and offices were raided by detectives last month over fraud and corruption allegations. One man who knew him before the claims were made said there was little to explain such extreme behaviour. “I didn’t think he was so depressed that he would jump out of a window, but this isn’t a simple issue,” he said. Monte dei Paschi, Italy’s third largest bank is at the centre of an investigation into how hundreds of millions of euros went missing during the costly 2008 acquisition of Antonveneta bank and risky derivative trades.
