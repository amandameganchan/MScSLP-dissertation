# ORIG CONTENT  Rescue workers in the Czech Republic are still picking through the rubble for people after a suspected gas explosion on Monday tore apart an office building. The blast occurred in the Old Town tourist district in the centre of Prague. At least 35 people were injured. The streets around the brick building, which dates back almost a century, were still strewn with glass and debris on Tuesday. Firefighters believe everyone is already accounted for but have joined in the search in case someone is still trapped amongst the rubble. The first and second floors are thought to have been entirely demolished. The explosion sent shockwaves through surrounding buildings but theyâ€™ve been assessed as structurally safe.
