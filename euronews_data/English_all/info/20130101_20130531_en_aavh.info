# ORIG TITLE    FARC end ceasefire in Colombia . 
# ORIG CONTENT  True to their word, Colombia’s FARC guerillas have called off their two-month unilateral ceasefire. Last November the FARC, which has been fighting the central government since 1964, called the ceasefire as peace talks began. But President Juan Manuel Santos rejected it from the outset, choosing to maintain military pressure to keep the FARC at the talks table. That now appears to have backfired, even if many people suspect the FARC’s move was a sham. The talks agenda tackles a number of difficult issues, notably rural development. In recent days the two sides have been in public disagreement about a FARC land redistribution proposal to hand over more than 20% of the country’s land to the poor.
