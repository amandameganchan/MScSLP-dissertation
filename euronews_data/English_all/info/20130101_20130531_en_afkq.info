# ORIG TITLE    Syrian media accuses Israel of air strike on Damascus . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Massive explosions rocked the Syrian capital on Sunday morning as state television reported Israeli rockets struck a military research centre on the outskirts of Damascus. Israel has not commented on this strike but it comes after an official confirmed – under condition of anonymity – that the Jewish state had attacked a consignment of missiles in Syria on Friday. It is also believed to be the same research centre Israel attacked in January. The country that borders Syria’s south west has previously made it clear that it is willing to use force to prevent advanced weapons reaching Hezbollah militants in Lebanon.
