# ORIG CONTENT  A prominent European commissioner has slammed the EU saying it is ‘ripe for an overhaul’. According to the German newspaper Bild, Guenther Oettinger told a Brussels Chamber of Commerce that too many in Europe still believe that everything will be fine. Oettinger, who is a well respected conservative politician in Germany, also described the economic situation in some member states as ‘alarming’. Italy came in for criticism with the 59-year-old describing it along with Bulgaria and Romania as being ‘essentially ungovernable’. While France, he said was unprepared to introduce pension reforms and to slash unnecessary public sector jobs. Oettinger’s remarks came on the eve of a report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development which predicts the eurozone will remain in recession for a second year. Unlike the US, the OECD said the 27-member bloc still needs to tackle problems in its financial sector.
