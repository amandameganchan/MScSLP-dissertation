# ORIG CONTENT  The 12th edition of the Volvo Ocean Race in 2014 will be the longest ever, after Race CEO Knut Frostad announced on Monday a route taking in 10 cities in nine countries and lasting almost nine months. The full race distance will be 39,895 nautical miles and will see the teams sail their newly constructed boats from the Raceâ€™s home in Alicante on October 4, 2014 before heading to Recife, Abu Dhabi, Sanya, Auckland, Itajai, Newport and Rhode Island. Lorient will be the penultimate Host Port along the route and will come immediately after Lisbon, as it did in the last edition, and before the grand finale, which this time will be in Gothenburg in June, 2015.
