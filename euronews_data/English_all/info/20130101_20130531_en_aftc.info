# ORIG TITLE    Mubarak back in court for retrial . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak has been back in court for a retrial on charges of complicity in the murder of protesters. Although convicted and sentenced to life in prison last June, a court ordered a second trial due to a weakness in prosecution evidence. Out side fewer people turned up than security officers had been expecting, reflecting a frustration with the effectiveness of the justice system. “ I think the court will never take any decision in the cases of killing the martyrs of the revolution, or stealing the people’s money and wealth, I am not optimistic,” said victim lawyer Naser Askalani. Mubarak and his former interior minister and four former aides are accused of involvement in the killing of more than 800 protesters in the 2011 uprising. “Hosni Mubarak should be executed in Tahrir Square, because he caused the loss of so many young people’s lives and he and his thieving colleagues looted the country,” said one angry Mubarak opponent. But for many Mubarak loyalists his trial is a travesty and his ousting has just brought in instability and a ruined economy. “He sacrificed his age and thirty years of rule for us, he did not take anything and then they threw him behind bars. It’s not right because he is a symbol of Egypt.” . Reporting for euronews, Correspondent Mohammed Shaikhibrahim said: . “ A second trial of the century gives a kind of satisfaction among Mubarak supporters but increases anxiety among his opponents that he may be declared innocent… While the average Egyptian on the street just wants the issue to be resolved as soon as possible because they are afraid the case will die and the truth be lost with it.” .
