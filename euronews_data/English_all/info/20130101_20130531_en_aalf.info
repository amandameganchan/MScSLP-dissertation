# ORIG TITLE    A dream in the sky goes under review . 
# ORIG CONTENT  It is a dream which is losing its appeal. US aviation regulators have announced they will launch a review of Boeing’s 787 passenger jet following a host of safety incidents. A crack in the cockpit window of an All Nippon Airways plane is the most recent. The passenger and crew were not affected though the plane remains grounded. The review will put a special focus on the 787’s electrical systems. An electrical fire broke out on a Japan Airlines’ Dreamliner shortly after it landed in Boston following a flight from Tokyo on Monday. That was one of five separate incidents which affected the airliner in the space of a week. The new head of the US Federal Aviation Administration Michael Huerta told journalists at a news conference on Friday that he believed the aircraft is safe. Plane makers Boeing have denied the problems were caused by ramping up production too quickly.
