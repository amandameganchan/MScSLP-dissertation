# ORIG TITLE    Canadian police foil al-Qaeda linked terror plot . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Canadian police have arrested and charged two men with plotting to attack a passenger train in the greater Toronto area which they said could have resulted in many deaths and injuries. Officers claimed the suspects who are not Canadian citizens had been given guidance by al-Qaeda elements. It is the first known al-Qaeda backed plot on Canadian soil. “The individuals were receiving support from al-Qaeda elements located in Iran. Now I can tell you that there is no information to indicate that these attacks were State sponsored,” said Royal Canadian Mounted Police official, James Malizia. The two suspects are said to have been targeting the rail network around Toronto but not necessarily a specific train. The alleged plotters had apparently been under investigation for over a year but police said at no time were the public or the infrastructure in any danger. The officers also denied any relation to the Boston Marathon bombings.
