# ORIG CONTENT  Violence flares on the streets of Paris after a largely peaceful protest against France’s new gay marriage law. The organisers say a million people had turned up – but the police estimate stands at 150 thousand. Things turned nasty as the protesters dispersed. Police say several hundred people began throwing metal barriers, smoke flares and beer bottles. Teargas was used. 96 people have been arrested. The government had warned that far-right activists might try to hi-jack the protest – billed as a final show-of-force by opponents of the bill, voted into law on May the 18th. Earlier in the day, some had managed to unfurl a banner at the Socialist Party headquarters calling for President Francois Hollande to resign. France is the 14th country to legalise same-sex marriage. One survey published Sunday suggests nearly three-quarters of French people think the protests should now stop.
