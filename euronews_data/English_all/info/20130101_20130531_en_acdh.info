# ORIG TITLE    French family kidnapped in Cameroon . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Seven French nationals, four of them children, have been abducted in northern Cameroon. They are all members of the same family and were on holiday in the country. The kidnapping took place only around 10kms from the Nigerian border and there are reports that the gunmen were seen taking their victims towards Nigeria on motorbikes. French President Hollande, on a visit, to Greece, said the kidnappers were from a known extremist Islamist group based in Nigeria: “I am referring particularly to a terrorist group called Boko Haram which exists in this part of Cameroon. And this is worrying enough for us to take action. France is in Mali and we will continue until our mission is complete, and we are carrying out actions and operations but at the same time the international community must also fight terrorism because it isn’t only in Mali.” . The risk of attacks on French nationals has been heightened since the French army intervened in Mali. Eight French nationals are already being held in West Africa by groups affiliated to Al-Qaeda. Seven foreign workers were also snatched from the premises of Lebanese company Setraco, in northern Nigeria.
