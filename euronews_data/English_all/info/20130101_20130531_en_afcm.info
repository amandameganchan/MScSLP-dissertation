# ORIG TITLE    Badgley shines as Jeff Buckley . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The film ‘Greetings From Tim Buckley’ follows the journey of musician Jeff Buckley as he struggles with the legacy of his late musician father, Tim, who released a number of albums in the late 1960s and early 1970s spanning genres as diverse as folk, rock, funk and jazz, stuffed with daring lyrics. Penn Badgley, last seen in the hit ‘Margin Call’, plays Jeff Buckley. “When looking at Jeff Buckley, it’s definitely a worthwhile endeavour to look at Tim Buckley as well and that’s what we did,” Badgley said. Tim Buckley died of a drug overdose in 1975 and Jeff said he only met him once when he was a child. Despite his father’s absence in his life, Jeff Buckley followed in his dad’s footsteps by pursuing a career in music. In the 1990s he built up a following by performing cover songs in New York City. “I was aware of just the karmic responsibility from one human to another of playing him; so that to me was actually far more important than worrying about what his fans might think, because I think the truth is that anybody that appreciates his music, if they’re ever to see this, I think they’ll understand what we’re going for.” . Jeff himself died young in a swimming accident, but the two men leave behind a body of work that has a cult following, and time only adds lustre to their critical reputation.
