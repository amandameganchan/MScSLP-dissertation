# ORIG CONTENT  The Nobel-prize winning neuroscientist Rita Levi-Montalcini has been laid to rest in Turin. The 103-year-old, who died at her home in Rome last Sunday, won the award in 1986 for her work on neurones. Born into a Jewish family, she continued her research at home when forced to leave her job in 1938 due to racial legislation.
