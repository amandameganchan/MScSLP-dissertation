# ORIG TITLE    New reign begins as Willem-Alexander takes the Dutch throne . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A new era in Dutch history has begun after a day of celebrations in which Willem-Alexander became the first king of the Netherlands since 1890. His mother Queen Beatrix – now beginning life once more as a princess – handed over the royal baton after signing away her throne. Royal representatives from Europe and beyond witnessed Willem-Alexander taking over a role which has been largely stripped of political power. However, it still has enormous symbolic significance for the Dutch people. And of course with his own three daughters he has secured the next royal generation. With the country traditionally awash in the national colour orange, April 30 or Queen’s Day, has always been an occasion for partying in the Netherlands, but this year there was an extra excuse to push the boat out – literally with a right royal river pageant .
