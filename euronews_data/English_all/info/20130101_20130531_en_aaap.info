# ORIG TITLE    Pakistan frees more members of the Taliban . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Pakistan has freed the ex-justice minister of the Taliban, along with three other prisoners. Talks have been underway to get certain Taliban detainees freed to help bolster the peace process. Pakistan had already released 13 Afhgan Taliban members in November. Afghan President Hamid Karzai established his 70-member High Peace Council more than two years ago to open negotiations with militants. However, the council has struggled to manage the distrust between militants and the government in Kabul. NATO troops are scheduled to withdraw from Afghanistan by the end of 2014 and Kabul hopes releasing senior figures will help integrate militants into peace talks.
