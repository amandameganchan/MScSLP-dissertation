# ORIG CONTENT  People angry at what they perceive as US support for Egyptian president Mohamed Mursi have been protesting during a visit by the US Secretary of State, John Kerry. It is Kerry’s first official trip to Egypt and he is keen to stress the value of political consensus, despite Liberal and leftist parties planning a boycott of next month’s parliamentary elections. “We’re not here to interfere. We’re here to listen. We’re not here to urge anybody to take one particular action or another, though we have our point of view, and certainly I will express that: what we support is democracy,” said Kerry. Kerry has already met with opposition leaders and is due to meet the president on Sunday. The new Secretary of State said he hopes the Egyptian government will gain cross party approval for painful economic reforms in order to secure a much-needed IMF loan. euronews correspondent in Cairo Mohammed Shaikhibrahim said: “During his visit, Kerry will try to facilitate a political settlement between the Egyptian government and opposition parties to end, at least the opposition’s election boycott and maintain balanced relations between the US administration and Egypt’s various political parties”.
