# ORIG CONTENT  A frail-looking Hillary Clinton has been discharged from hospital in New York. Officials have given no information about where the US Secretary of State was going. She was been admitted for treatment at the weekend for a blood clot behind her right ear. A hospital spokesperson directed all queries about the 65-year-old to the State Department, which had no immediate comment. Clinton was driven away with her husband Bill, her daughter Chelsea and an aide. The State Department announced on Sunday that Clinton was in a New York hospital for treatment of a blood clot that stemmed from a concussion in mid-December, itself the result of a fainting spell due to a stomach virus. Clintonâ€™s doctors treated the clot with anti-coagulants and are confident she will make a full recovery.
