# ORIG TITLE    Video: how North Korea would destroy US and S. Korean enemies . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A video posted on a website used by North Korea to promote itself to the outside world shows how the country imagines defeating its American and South Korean enemies. A Korean narration over the video tells of how North Korean troops would emerge victorious from a three-day “lightning war” after destroying US military bases in Guam and Japan and occupying its neighbour South Korea. The video was posted to the semi-official Uriminzokkiri website, an online arm of North Korea’s central news agency. A recent tightening of UN sanctions against North Korea have prompted the reclusive state to threaten a nuclear war with the United States and verbally scrap a 60-year ceasefire in the officially unfinished war with South Korea.
