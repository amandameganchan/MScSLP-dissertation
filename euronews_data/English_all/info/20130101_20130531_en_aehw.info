# ORIG TITLE    Falkland reactions to Thatcher death . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The death of former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher draws attention to a place many consider pivotal to her role as premier – the Falkland Islands. The 74 days of war against Argentina in 1982 ordered by Thatcher is seen as a war of liberation by many on the Islands. Speaking about Thatcher’s death, member of Legislative Assembly in the Falkland Islands Mike Summers said: “It’s a very sad day for the people of the Falkland Islands. Mrs Thatcher is obviously very well-remembered and well-loved for being the person who led the liberation of the Falklands in 1982.” . Recently-released papers from the Margaret Thatcher Archive Trust show uncertainty from the government before the war, but Thatcher is still seen as determined by people living on the Islands. “I never had any doubt of the outcome, simply because there was an extremely strong, very high principled leader in charge of the whole operation,” said Port Stanley resident Phil Middleton. “She is, always will be the ‘Iron Lady’ to us and if wasn’t for her, I probably wouldn’t be here today,” added Port Stanley shopkeeper Sybie Summers. Having faced opposition from her cabinet, the 1982 conflict helped seal the image of Britain’s longest-serving and only female prime minister as unbending and uncompromising.
