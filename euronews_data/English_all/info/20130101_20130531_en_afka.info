# ORIG TITLE    Juve crowned Italian champion . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Juventus won the Serie A title for the second straight season and 29th overall on Sunday following a 1-0 win over Palermo. Although some fans would argue it’s the club’s 31st title despite being stripped of two crowns for their involvement in a match-fixing scandal eight years ago. Arturo Vidal converted a 59th-minute penalty against Palermo to secure the win and make it mathematically impossible for Juve to be caught by second-placed Napoli with three games remaining.
