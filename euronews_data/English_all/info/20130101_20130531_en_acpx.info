# ORIG TITLE    Manning admits leaking confidential US information to Wikileaks . 
# ORIG CONTENT  US soldier Bradley Manning has admitted being the source of classified material provided to the Wikileaks website. In front of a military court, US army private Manning, 25, pleaded guilty to 10 out of 22 charges, saying he leaked the documents because he thought Americans had a right to know “the true cost of war”. Accused of the biggest leak of state secrets in US history, Manning was arrested in May 2010 for sending Wikileaks thousands of intelligence documents, diplomatic cables and combat videos. Manning faces a maximum of 20 years in prison for the offences he admitted – but will receive time off due to harsh treatment he suffered at Quantico Marine Base in Virginia where he has been held for over 1,000 days. For some of his imprisonment, Manning was in solitary confinement for up to 23 hours a day. Manning pleaded not guilty to 12 charges, including the most serious one of aiding the enemy, which could lead to a life sentence. The trial will begin in June.
