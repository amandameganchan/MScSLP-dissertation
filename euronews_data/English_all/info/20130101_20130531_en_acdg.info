# ORIG TITLE    Oymyakon – the world’s coldest inhabited place . 
# ORIG CONTENT  If you are tired of shivering and shaking because there seems no end in sight to winter, then spare a thought for residents of a Russian town that claims to be the coldest inhabited place on Earth. Oymyakon lies deep in Siberia’s Yakutia region and temperatures routinely drop to below minus 60 Celsius. Lumberjack Alexei Yegorov says it has been like this for years: “When I was at school it was minus 60-61 every year and it’s still like this every year, at least ten days in a row.” . Extremely low temperatures are far from being the only record held by Oymyakon. Permafrost means the land is resource rich with diamonds, gold, silver, oil and gas. What’s more the Yakutian horse may well be called one of the wonders of the region. It is relatively small, but perfectly formed and very hardy.
