# ORIG TITLE    Tensions high at Israel-Syria border . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Israel is on high alert after carrying out air strikes on military targets in Syria at the weekend. The Israeli government has already sent more tanks to its northern border, while two missile batteries are also to be stationed there amid concern that Damascus could retaliate. Despite the tension, tourists in the Golan Heights area said they were not alarmed. American Alan Bernstein described the atmosphere: “If we hadn’t looked on the Internet, we wouldn’t really know about it. Obviously, we heard the tanks manoeuvring and we heard some shells fired, but that’s kind of normal. We’ve been in Golan before.” . Israeli officials said the strikes were carried out to prevent Iranian missiles reaching Lebanon’s Hezbollah. Syria described the attack as an “act of war”.
