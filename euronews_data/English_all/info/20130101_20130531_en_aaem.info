# ORIG CONTENT  Austria’s Marcel Hirscher overcame a shaky start to reclaim the overall World Cup lead in Croatia on Sunday. The defending champion trailed Jens Byggmark by 0.01 seconds after the first leg but held his nerve in the second to outclass his opponents and clinch his third slalom of the season in a combined time of 1 minute, 56.17 seconds. Sweden’s Andre Myhrer produced a solid run but it wasn’t to be for the 29 year old who eventually had to settle for second place ahead of Austria’s Mario Matt. Hirscher now leads Norway’s Aksel Lund Svindal by 51 points in the overall standings with America’s Ted Ligety in third place, 137 points further back.
