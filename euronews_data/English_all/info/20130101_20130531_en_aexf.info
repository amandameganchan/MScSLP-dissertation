# ORIG TITLE    Boston falls silent for bomb victims . 
# ORIG CONTENT  One week on and the city of Boston paused in silent tribute to the victims of the Marathon bombings . At exactly 2.50pm local time survivors, friends and officials marked the moment when two bombs exploded killing three people and maiming scores of others, many of whom lost limbs. But a lot has happened in a week; two suspects have been identified – one is dead, the other, his brother lies severely wounded in hospital. Dzokhar Tsarnaev has now been officially charged with using a weapon of mass destruction and of malicious destruction of property resulting in death. If convicted he could be sentenced to death or life in prison. White House Spokesman Jay Carney explained why Tsarnaev who is an ethnic Chechen will be tried under civil law: . “He will not be treated as an enemy combatant. We will prosecute this terrorist through our civilian system of justice. Under US law, United States citizens cannot be trialled, tried rather, in military commissions, and it is important to remember that, since 9/11, we have used the federal court system to convict and incarcerate hundreds of terrorists.” . Monday saw the first of the funerals to be held – 29-year-old restaurant manager Krystle Campbell had gone to watch a friend finish the race. Chinese graduate student Lingzi Lu and 8-year-old Martin Richard also died in the bombings.
