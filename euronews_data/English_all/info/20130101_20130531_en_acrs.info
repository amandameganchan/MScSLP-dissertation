# ORIG TITLE    Jean Paul Gaultier at Paris Fashion Week . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Jean Paul Gaultier has shown his autumn/winter collection at Paris Fashion Week. The inspiration was clothes as body armour but overall, the style was eclectic and hard to pin down. British designer Vivienne Westwood’s collection was colourful, ethnic and historically-inspired with lots of references to medieval Europe and the exchanges with the Arab world which resulted from the Crusades. Dutch design duo Viktor and Rolf presented an unfettered and monochromatic collection which was something of a departure from their usual theatrical style.
