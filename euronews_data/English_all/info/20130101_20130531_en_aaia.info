# ORIG TITLE    Entrepreneurs want EU to cut red tape now . 
# ORIG CONTENT  For years, the EU has talked about unleashing the growth potential of Europe’s start-ups. But entrepreneurs complain there is still too much red tape for that happen. That is the view of 35-year-old Dirk Loeckx, who runs a company in Leuven, Belgium that specialises in analysing medical images. “The thing that I would like to change most is to make the legislation more easy, the legislation has always a lot of exceptions,” he told euronews. “Certainly as hi-tech company we are always within the exceptions. We do a lot of international business, we hire people from abroad, all these things are always the exception and it is not easy to find out what you can do, and how you should it all these things.” . The EU executive wants to improve access to finance, encourage the shift to a digital economy and design better training for entrepreneurs. Antonio Tajani, the European commissioner for entrepreneurship and industry, said the changes should start in school. “We will do everything so that 2 hours of lessons in secondary school will be dedicated to teach entreprenership. We want to give the chance to the young students in their last year at school to spend 2 or 3 months in a company,” he said. The Association of European Chambers of Commerce and Industry reckons the Commission’s proposals don’t go far enough. “We are a little bit disappointed that Commission has fallen into the trap of trying to include everything possible in the Entrepreneurship Action Plan,” said Ben Butters, the group’s director of European affairs. “In our view it extend much further than just tackling the issue of how to make want to became entrepreneurs.” . An EU study found 37 percent of Europeans want to be their own boss, but are put off from doing so by the current crisis.
