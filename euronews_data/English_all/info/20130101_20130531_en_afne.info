# ORIG TITLE    Pyongyang pulls back missiles . 
# ORIG CONTENT  After weeks of tension and uncertainty, North Korea is said to have taken two missiles off launch-ready status. They have also been moved from their position on the countryâ€™s east coast. But a US official has said that it is no guarantee that they will not be fired at some point in the future. The Musudan missiles have a range of up to 3,500 kilometres. A possible test launch could have dramatically increased tensions in the region and beyond.
