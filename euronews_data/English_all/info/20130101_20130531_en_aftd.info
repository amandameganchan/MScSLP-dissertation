# ORIG TITLE    Beyoncé: from pop royalty to cartoon queen . 
# ORIG CONTENT  She’s already pop royalty and now Beyoncé is queen of the cartoon with her new role in the children’s animated film Epic. She says she loved voicing Queen Tara, when she could control her emotions: “It was the first job I had after giving birth and I felt really hormonal and I was so emotional and there was a scene where Queen Tara picks out her pod, and I just imagined seeing my child. So it was really emotional for me and it was great to have that to get that emotion out.” . Epic follows a teenager – played by Amanda Seyfried – who is magically transported into a secret forest where she finds herself involved in a battle of good and evil. Beyoncé is currently on tour – where her performances are a far cry from Queen Tara. She said: “I’m not one dimensional. I have different feelings everyday and now that I’ve done movies I feel like I can try and recreate these characters on the stage and recreate these characters through my music. “So it was really interesting how doing these movies kind of gave me more guts to kind of step outside of myself.” . Epic opens in the UK on May 24.
