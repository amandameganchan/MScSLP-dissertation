# ORIG TITLE    US cardinal urged to stay away from conclave . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A Catholic association in the United States is urging a retired cardinal not travel to Rome for the ceremony to elect the new Pope. Benedict the 16th’s resignation last week took most by surprise. It came two weeks after the release of records showing that, in the 1980s, former Archbishop of Los Angeles Roger Mahony shielded dozens of priests accused of abuse. He has been relieved of his duties. Mahony has apologised for what he describes as “mistakes” he made while in office. But for some people that is not enough. Victims’ groups say apologies mean little without action. They want Cardinal Mahony to stay out of the public eye in respect for those who were abused by priests while he was in office.
