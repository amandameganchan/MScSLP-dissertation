# ORIG CONTENT  News of the death of Hugo Chavez broke during a press conference at the UN in New York. There was an immediate reaction from Ban ki-Moon to the death of the man who enjoyed some colourful moments at the General Assembly. “As a president of Venezuela he has been making his own contributions to his country’s development at the same time as the Secretary-General. I will be able to issue a more formal statement, I’d like to convey my deepest condolence to the families and people and government of Venezuela on the loss of President Chavez.” . Russian Ambassador to the UN, Vitaly Churkin,made his feelings clear: “You know, I think it’s a tragedy. He was, I think, a great politician for his country, for Latin America and for the world and of course he played a very important role in the development of relations between Venezuela and Russia, so we feel very badly about it. Thank you very much.” . The world is waiting to see which path Venezuela – which has the second largest oil reserves in the world – will take now.
