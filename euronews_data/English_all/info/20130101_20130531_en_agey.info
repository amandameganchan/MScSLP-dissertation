# ORIG CONTENT  Sochi Winter Olympic organisers say authorities will ensure security at the ‘‘highest possible level.’‘ . A deadly bombing at the Boston Marathon in April has renewed fears of security arrangements in the Russian seaside resort. Sochi organizing committee leader Dmitry Chernyshenko said that the government is doing its best to ensure security at the games. He stressed that the Boston bombings prove that terrorism is a ‘‘global threat’‘. He said: “This question was raised about the security. And the answer was traditional which was proven by our observer from the International Olympic Committee that the security is at the highest possible level and the state is doing the utmost to deliver the most safest Games ever.” . Sochi is close to Russia’s southern provinces which have been engulfed in Islamic insurgency since the War in Chechnya in the 1990s. British Prime Minister David Cameron has visited Sochi and pledged his country’s cooperation with Russia to boost security preparations for the games.
