# ORIG CONTENT  In a sign of rising drug-related violence in France’s second largest city, a 17 year-old has been killed. The teenager was shot more than 20 times with a nine-millimetre automatic pistol. Marseilles Prosecutor Christophe Barret said that gang rivalries were at the root of the crime: . “This was an incident to do with score-settling, a premeditated murder committed by two determined men using high calibre weapons,” Barret said. Marseilles, which is France’s second largest city, has been plagued by a wave of shootings in recent years. There have been six so far in 2013 according to police. French Interior Minister Manuel Valls told reporters: “There is no doubt sometimes a feeling of powerlessness and fatalism about these killings. But the murders mustn’t detract from the background work we are doing to reclaim territories, to bring security to Marseilles.” . The crime wave has reached such levels that last year a local official called for the military to be sent in and the government formed a task force to tackle it.
