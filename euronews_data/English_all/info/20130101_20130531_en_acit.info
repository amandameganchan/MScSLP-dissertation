# ORIG TITLE    Michael Haneke film ‘Amour’ sweeps major César awards in Oscars warm-up . 
# ORIG CONTENT  It had already won the Palme d’Or at Cannes, a Golden Globe and several other awards internationally – now the French-language film “Amour” has taken a clean sweep of the major prizes at the French “Césars” ceremony in Paris. The tale of the relationship between an elderly couple in the face of declining health won the Austrian filmmaker Michael Haneke the award of best film, best director and best screenplay, while Emmanuelle Riva and Jean-Louis Trintignant took best actress and best actor respectively. The director was not present to receive the prizes – he is in Los Angeles where “Amour” is in the running for the Oscars. The big favourite to take Hollywood’s accolades, Ben Affleck’s “Argo”, was named best foreign film, while another American was present to receive an honorary award recognising his career. Kevin Costner said he was grateful to French cinema for accepting him “as he is”.
