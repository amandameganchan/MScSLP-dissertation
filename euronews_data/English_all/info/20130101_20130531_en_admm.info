# ORIG CONTENT  Protests in the streets and closed banks after Cyprus’s financial time-bomb exploded. The island has been asking Europe for help for some time, but the conditions for that aid, when it finally came, shocked many.

And what could this mean for the global banking system? . We discuss all this with Nejra Cehic from Bloomberg in this edition of Business Weekly.
