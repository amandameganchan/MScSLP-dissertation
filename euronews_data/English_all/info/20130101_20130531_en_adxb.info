# ORIG TITLE    Russian superheroes fight the fat . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Protesters dressed as superheroes took to the Moscow streets to take on an enemy they want to quash: unhealthy, fatty food. A group of masked and caped protesters gathered in front of a monument to writer Leo Tolstoy – calling for the government to do more to clean up the Russian diet. They carried placards saying “be fit” and “fat is not our friend”. The venue was chosen because the Russian word for fat sounds like Tolstoy. Protest leader ‘Fatman’ said: “I’m the chairman of the superheroes trade union. Our motto is ‘We’re saving people, but who will save us from death from fat?” . According to the Russian Ministry of Health, 55 percent of the population are overweight and 24 percent are obese.
