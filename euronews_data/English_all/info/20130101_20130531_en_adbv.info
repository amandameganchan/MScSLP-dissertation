# ORIG CONTENT  New ways of interacting with computers have proliferated in recent years with technology like touch screens, motion-sensing and eye-tracking. Swedish company Tobii Technology specialises in eye tracking and gaze interaction. At CeBIT they presented an eye-tracking application which works with Windows 8. REX peripheral is a strip-shaped device that sticks to the base of the computer screen and plugs into the computer via a USB. Nicolas Pezzarossa, the General Manager Tobii Germany, said: “Right here, I am using Windows 8 and various applications which I can launch by looking at them. Right here we have set it up so you select with your gaze and then confirm by pushing a key. In this instance, I’m opening the calculator. I can return to the Windows desktop and open the email-application. We are offering a new platform for developers, who can make their applications eye-tracking-able. Because we think that next year, lots of consumer products will hit the market, using eye-tracking.” . Also on show at CeBIT were 3D-glasses from German manufacturer Zeiss. The Cinemizer OLED is equipped with a new head tracking accessory measuring head movement for an overall more realistic virtual-3D experience. In conjunction with a compatible 3D PC game, playing with a spherical view becomes more immersive. (The Cinemizer OLED was introduced 2012, available at 649 euros, while the Headtracker accessory will be available at the beginning of April in shops and online for 199 euros.) . Meanwhile IBM is developing super-computing technology in conjunction with an international project to inspect the radio remnants of the Big Bang. They are working on this via a five-year partnership with the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy (Astron). The Square Kilometer Array Telescope will be built between 2016 and 2024 in South Africa and Australia.
