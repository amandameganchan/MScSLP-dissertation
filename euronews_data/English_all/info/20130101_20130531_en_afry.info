# ORIG TITLE    Former Egyptian president in court for retrial . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak has once again appeared in court in Cairo. He is facing a retrial on charges of complicity in the murder of protesters during the 2011 uprising that led to the end of his rule. Four top aides are also charged. Mubarak’s sons, Alaa and Gamal, were also present on charges of financial corruption. The retrial was ordered after an appeals court in January accepted both prosecution and defense appeals. The case has revealed the real difficulties that Egyptians face in attaining justice. The judiciary and security forces are still largely controlled by figures appointed during the former president’s regime. Mubarak and his former interior minister, Habib el-Adli, were sentenced to life imprisonment last June and became the first ruler to stand trial after being toppled during the Arab Spring.
