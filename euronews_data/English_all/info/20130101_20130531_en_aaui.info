# ORIG TITLE    Rajoy vows action over latest party corruption allegations . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Protesters targeted the Madrid headquarters of the ruling People’s Party on Saturday night, over new revelations about a former party treasurer, embroiled in an ongoing corruption inquiry. One Spanish newspaper alleged that Luis Barcenas had – over 20 years – collected illegal payments from companies and distributed them to leading party members. Court papers have also revealed that he held a secret Swiss bank account worth 22 million euros. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy promised to take action against wrongdoers in his party: “If at any point I am aware of irregular or inappropriate conduct related to members of our party, I will not waiver, I will not waiver,” he said. Amid Spain’s deep debt crisis, the opposition has seized on the scandal. Socialist leader Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said: “If it is proven, and it seems it will be, that Mr Barcenas used fiscal amnesty to launder his money, then the finance minister must resign.” . Barcenas stepped down in 2009 when the probe began into alleged kickbacks from businesses to party officials.
