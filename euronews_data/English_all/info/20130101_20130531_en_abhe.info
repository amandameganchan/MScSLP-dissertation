# ORIG CONTENT  A Colombian priest has been arrested in Moscow for drug smuggling. Anti-narcotic officers say they detained Fabio Ricardo Rodriguez at Sheremetyevo airport because his “sickly appearance and nervous behaviour” made them suspicious. Thirteen cocaine-filled condoms were found in his stomach, and another five packages of the drug in his luggage – weighing a total of 780g. During an interview on Russian television, the Anglican priest said: . “Since I am a priest, this situation is very complex. It goes against my morals and my convictions, but I was forced by a mafia gang to commit this action, I had no choice.” . Rodriguez could spend between 10 and 15 years in prison for the offence.
