# ORIG TITLE    Russian trial of dead lawyer Magnitsky continues . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Proceedings resumed on April 1 in the Moscow trial of Russian anti-corruption lawyer Sergey Magnitsky – who died in prison in 2009. Magnitsky is accused by the Russian state of helping investment fund Hermitage Capital and its boss Bill Browder avoid paying millions of euros in taxes. Browder, who is American, is also on trial. Browder and Magnitsky’s family have refused to cooperate in the case, calling it a travesty of justice. At the time of Magnitsky’s arrest, he was investigating the alleged theft of more than 170 million euros by Interior Ministry officials. His family say he was mistreated and denied medical care in jail, but no-one has been held criminally responsible for his death. His arrest and prison treatment soured relations between Moscow and Washington, which has honoured Magnitsky for his anti-corruption activities.
