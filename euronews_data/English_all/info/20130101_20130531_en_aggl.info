# ORIG TITLE    Pussy Riot member denied parole by Russian judge . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A Russian court has refused to grant parole to a jailed member of the Pussy Riot punk band. According to supporters, the judge ruled against Maria Alyokhina because she had broken prison rules. The breaches included not making her bed and writing letters during meal times. She was jailed after performing a so-called punk prayer in a Moscow cathedral against Vladimir Putin, during his reelection campaign. Alyokhina said on Wednesday that she had gone on hunger strike because she was not allowed to attend the parole proceedings in person.
