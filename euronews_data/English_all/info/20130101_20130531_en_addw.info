# ORIG CONTENT  Rembrandt’s “Portrait of the Father,” has been returned to the Serbian museum from where it was stolen seven years ago. Police found the painting by the 17th century Dutch master, worth around 3 million euros, just 65 kilometres away. This piece was stolen from Novi Sad City Museum in January 2006, by masked robbers who also took three other paintings; “Seneca” by Rubens, “Night Landscape with a Fisherman” by Pier Francesco Mola and “Head of Christ” by an unknown Dutch or German artist from the 16th century. The other three works are still missing. Four arrests were reported.
