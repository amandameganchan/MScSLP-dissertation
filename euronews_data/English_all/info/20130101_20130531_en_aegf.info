# ORIG CONTENT  Fresh sectarian violence in Cairo on Sunday, left one person dead and more than 80 wounded, Egyptian state media reported. The 30-year-old who was killed, identified as Mahrous Hana Tadros, was one of hundreds of Christians at an Orthodox Cathedral in the city centre, attending the funerals of four Christians killed in clashes on Friday. Confrontations between Muslims and Christians have increased since the fall of autocratic president Hosni Mubarak in 2011. There have been conflicting reports of who started the latest confrontation that soon resulted in the throwing of stones and petrol bombs. Eleven policemen were reported among the wounded. President Mohammed Mursi condemned the attack and reportedly called the Coptic Orthodox Pope to show solidarity. Still many Christians blame the Muslim Brotherhood for the violence. Anti-government slogans were chanted as the coffins were carried from the cathedral.
