# ORIG CONTENT  Giorgio Napolitano has been elected president of Italy for a second term. Napolitano was due to stand down on May 15, but the failure of parliament to elect his successor after five attempts prompted party leaders to hold last-minute meetings with the 87-year-old to persuade him to stand again. President Napolitano will now play a vital role in forming a new government for Italy after inconclusive results in the February election. Italian politics is gridlock at a time of recession, high unemployment and falling living standards. The prospect of the eurozoneâ€™s third largest economy operating without either an elected government or head of state would have further fueld insecurity.
