# ORIG TITLE    Tensions high on Jerusalem Day . 
# ORIG CONTENT  On Jerusalem Day, a national holiday in Israel, there were scuffles between Israelis and Palestinians at the city’s Damascus Gate. Tens of thousands of Israelis marched through the city to commemorate the 1967 annexation of East Jerusalem – a move that is not recognised internationally. Israeli police were out in force during the event, and 13 people were arrested. Earlier, Jerusalem’s leading Muslim cleric Sheikh Mohammed Hussein was detained by Israeli police for questioning over violence that erupted outside the al-Aqsa mosque on May 7. He was released without charge. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas condemned the arrest.
