# ORIG TITLE    In Mali rebels try to buy support . 
# ORIG CONTENT  In the Malian city of Diabaly, life is slowly returning to normal following French-Malian military efforts to regain control of the key town from al-Qaeda linked militants. Euronews correspondent Francois Chignac reports from Diabaly on how the conflict is developing. He states that securing Diabaly has allowed French soldiers to protect their North-western front. Any further move northwards would have been impossible without this protection since the risk of rebel operations from Diabaly on the French-Malian front was significant. Soldiers from Chad have now arrived on Malian soil. A French officer has told our correspondent that the Chadian soldiers were accustomed to fighting in the desert, which will be a great advantage when fighting the rebels on home turf. Several residents of Diabaly confirmed to our correspondent that as soon as the rebels arrive in a town, they offer men money in exchange for their loyalty.
