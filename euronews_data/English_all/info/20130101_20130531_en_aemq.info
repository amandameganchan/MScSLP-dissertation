# ORIG TITLE    Kerry in China for talks on North Korea . 
# ORIG CONTENT  U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is in Beijing as part of his four day East Asia tour. Along with strengthening relations between the United States and China, he will also discuss the deepening Korean Peninsula Crisis. Kerry hopes to persuade China’s top leaders to put pressure on North Korea to scale back its rhetoric and eventually return to talks over it nuclear programme. While John Kerry holds talks in China, NATO General Anders Fogh Rasmussen has visited the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that divides North and South Korea. This is his first visit to the area since taking office. It is hoped that China can help to reach a solution to the crisis because of its unique position as Pyongyang’s main trading partner, financial backer and diplomatic ally. However, the country has been reluctant to put pressure on Pyongyang fearing the instability that could come with the end of the regime.
