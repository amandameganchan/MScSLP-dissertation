# ORIG TITLE    Hoeness gets into a pickle over possible unpaid tax . 
# ORIG CONTENT  For two decades Bayern Munich’s president Uli Hoeness has been sounding off about free-spending clubs living beyond their means, or having barely-legal financial positions and bossing the transfer market, while claiming his beloved Bayern has been the epitome of well-managed propriety. Well now he is accused of having a Swiss bank account with, say some estimates 200 million euros stashed away, and the state prosecutors’ office in Munich is going after him with an official enquiry into possible tax evasion. “We have opened a preliminary inquiry into Uli Hoeness for suspected tax evasion. following a self-corrected tax return in January 2013. We will examine the effectiveness and completeness of the amended return. Further comments as to the course and content of the proceedings are not being made at this time,” said a spokesman for the state prosecutor’s office Ken Heidenreich. Hoeness denies any wrongdoing and is attacking what he calls “excesses in some media coverage”, but, as some have said, that is a lot of cash for a sausage-maker, Hoeness’s major business activity via his 1985 purchase of HoWe Wurstwaren, an industrial sausage market leader. If found guilty, few will forgive the fault from one who has loudly claimed football’s moral high ground for over 30 years.
