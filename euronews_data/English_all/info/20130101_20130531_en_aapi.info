# ORIG TITLE    Tributes paid to murdered Kurdish activists . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A memorial ceremony has taken place in Turkey to commemorate three Kurdish activists killed in Paris last week. The three women were shot after attending a Kurdish information centre in the French capital. But the motive behind the apparent assasinations is still unclear. Kurdish rebels have suggested they were political as the victims included a founding member of the Kurdish PKK militant group. Ankara, however, has repeated its claims that the killings appear to have been the result of an internal feud or a bid to derail fledgling peace talks. Speaking in parliament, Turkey’s Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said those who are accusing Turkey of being behind the deaths are acting extremely irresponsibly. Erdogan and other political leaders have also appealed for calm ahead of Thursday’s funerals of the three women activists who will be buried in Diyarkbakir, the largest city in Turkey’s mainly Kurdish southeast.
