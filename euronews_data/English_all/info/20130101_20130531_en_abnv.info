# ORIG TITLE    Picasso’s ‘Woman’ up for sale . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Impressionist master Pablo Picasso’s painting “Woman Seated by a Window” is to go under the hammer at Sotheby’s in London on February 5. “Woman Seated by a Window” has an estimated value of 40 million euros, but the auction house said it could fetch more than that. The piece, a portrait of the painter’s muse Marie-Therese Walter, was completed in 1932. Helena Newman, Chair of Impressionist and Modern Art at Sotheby’s Europe said: . “Most of the examples from this year and of his Marie-Therese subject are in museums around the world. So, it represents a real opportunity for a collector to buy a museum quality painting coming out of private hands.” . The auction house’s Impressionist and modern art evening sale also features works by Austrian artist Egon Schiele. The current record for a Schiele was set by Sotheby’s in 2011, when it sold one of his cityscapes for more than 25 million euros.
