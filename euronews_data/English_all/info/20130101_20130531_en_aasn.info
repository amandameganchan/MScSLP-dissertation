# ORIG CONTENT  The fight against Barack Obama’s proposed gun control measures is getting personal. The National Rifle Association has produced a video accusing the President of hypocrisy for accepting armed protection for his two girls in school while attempting to limit gun ownership for others. The White House labelled it “repugnant”. Insults aside, the issue here is a thorny one of individual rights vs public safety. “There is an extraordinary disconnect between what the American public wants, including gun owners and NRA (National Rifle Association) members and what our elected officials are doing about it. It is going to be up to us, the American public, to close that disconnect.” said Dan Gross, President of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence . In a year of similar tragedies, the Sandy Hook elementary school killings seem to have been one tragedy too far. Massachusetts has introduced laws tightening the sale of weapons and ammunition. The day before, New York State adopted some of the toughest new legislation in the US. It remains to be seen what Obama can do, given the cross-party political support for the NRA.
