# ORIG TITLE    Clashes in Madrid as Spain announces record jobless levels . 
# ORIG CONTENT  There were clashes between demonstrators and riot police outside the Spanish parliament building on Thursday, as the country revealed record high jobless figures. There are now more than six million unemployed in Spain; 27.2 percent of those eligible to work. The rally was organised by a group calling itself the “Stand Up” Platform which is trying to force the government to step down. Around 1,000 people took to the streets of Madrid for the protest but they were more than matched by some 1,400 police who were deployed to protect the parliament building from some of the more violent demonstrators. Earlier in the week two major “Indignado” groups – which staged the first “Occupy” protests – dissociated themselves from the demo as they did not share the “Stand Up” Platform’s objectives. After riot police dispersed demonstrators from the area around the parliament building, some broke away and headed for the Atocha station where they threw projectiles at police. At least one protester was arrested.
