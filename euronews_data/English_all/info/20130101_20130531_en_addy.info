# ORIG CONTENT  Catholics in Buenos Aires were overwhelmed with joy as the announcement came that Jorge Mario Bergoglio, a fellow Argentinian, is the new Pope. One man wearing from the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral said: “We were not expecting it but we are sure that he is going to be a great pope. We know him very well and we know that he is a saint and now he’s going to be even more saint. We are really happy.” . A worshipper from the cathedral added: “It’s very important, in a country that is facing a few conflicts this is going to unite us. We should stop thinking about the past and we should continue fighting for peace. This a peaceful country.” . The 76-year-old comes to power after a series of scandals at the Church and some have questioned his own actions in the past. “The fact that the first non-European pope comes from here is a boost not only for the church in Argentina but for the whole of Latin America. However, Francis the first has also been accused of having been too close to the military regime during the 1970s,” said euronews’ reporter in Buenos Aires, Oluf Bruns.
