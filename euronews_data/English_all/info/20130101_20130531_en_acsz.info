# ORIG CONTENT  Hedi Slimane has shown his collection for Yves St Laurent at Paris Fashion Week. The style was definitely rock and roll, with lots of grunge and rock chick black leather. British designer Stella McCartney presented her autumn/winter 2013-14 collection in front of a star-studded crowd. She combined masculine and feminine elements to produce minimalist, casual, easy-to-wear separates. The colour palette was mainly black, midnight blue and charcoal.
