# ORIG CONTENT  The President of Republika Srpska, Milorad Dodik, has angered Bosnian war victims during his appearance as a defence witness in the genocide trial of former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic. Like the defendant, Dodik blamed the Bosnian War on Muslim aggression, backing up Radovic’s claim that military action was only taken as a defence against it. Dodik’s testimony went down badly with the relatives of the 8,000 Muslim men and boys killed in Srebenica. Rejha Avdic, who lost two sons in the 1995 Srebenica massacre, said: . “Dodik can lie in court as much as he wants. He is ‘defending’ Republika Srpska, but does he know how Republika Srpska was created? It was created through genocide.” . Dodik’s testimony was also dismissed in Sarajevo, a city under siege during the war for almost four years. “According to Dodik, we should all be Republika Srpska now. That was the project of Radovan Karadzic,” said Sarajevo resident Mujo Sakalas. Karadzic is on trial at the Hague for the shelling of a besieged Sarajevo and the massacre of Bosnian Muslims at Srebrenica – the worst atrocity in Europe since the end of World War II.
