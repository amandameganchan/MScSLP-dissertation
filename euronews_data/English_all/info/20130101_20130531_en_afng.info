# ORIG CONTENT  German police have arrested a suspected former Auschwitz death camp guard. Prosecutors in Stuttgart said a 93-year-old had been detained amid “strong suspicion” that he was involved in murder there. Nazi-hunting group Simon Wiesenthal named him as Hans Lipschis – fourth on its list of most wanted Nazi criminals. Lipschis told a German newspaper last month that he had been a cook in the camp and had left to fight on the Eastern Front.
