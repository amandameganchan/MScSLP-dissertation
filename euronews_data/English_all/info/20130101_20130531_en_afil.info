# ORIG CONTENT  Georgia announced this week it will participate in the next year’s Winter Olympics in neighbouring Russia despite lingering resentment about the brief war between the countries almost five years ago. Some members of President Mikhail Saakashvili’s party strongly backed a boycott of the Games but the Georgian National Olympic Committee on Thursday voted unanimously to take part. Tamaz Tevzadze, the Georgian Deputy Minister of Sport and Youth Affairs said: “It (The decision) was not politicized. I found that the arguments presented here were connected only with the Olympic movement and were connected only with athletes who should participate in the Olympic Games.” . Russia and Georgia severed all diplomatic ties due to the Five-Day War that took place in August, 2008. As a result of the brief conflict Georgia lost control of South Ossetia and parts of the other breakaway region of Abkhazia. The latter is located just south of the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi, host city for the 2014 Winter Olympics.
