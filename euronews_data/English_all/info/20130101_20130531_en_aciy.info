# ORIG TITLE    Kelmendi shines in Germany . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Kosovo’s Majlinda Kelmendi produced a superb display to claim gold in the women’s under 52 kilo category at the Judo Grand Prix in Düsseldorf on Sunday. The 21 year old proved unstoppable en route to the top of the podium and struck early on in the final contest with this clinical waza-ari, leaving her opponent Andreea Chitu of Romania down and out. The bronze medals were won by Germany’s Mareen Kraeh and Japan’s Nodoka Tanimoto. In the under 63 kilo category, France’s Clarisse Agbegnenou looked in great shape as she clinched her second consecutive Grand Prix title. The 20 year old, who won in Paris earlier this month, edged out Yarden Gerbi in the semi finals and never looked in trouble in the showpiece match where she downed Japan’s Abe Kana.
