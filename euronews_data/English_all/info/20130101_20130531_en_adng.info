# ORIG CONTENT  A North Korean propaganda video showing an imagined invasion of the South Korea has been published online. The four-minute film depicts what is described by the narration as a “lightning” three-day war. The footage also shows the North Korean military destroying US bases in Japan and Guam. The video posting comes at a time of high tension between Pyongyang and the international community. Kim Jong-un’s regime carried out a nuclear test last month in defiance of United Nations resolutions. The UN stepped up sanctions following the test and Pyongyang responded with threatening the United States with attack. North Korea also announced earlier this month that it will no longer adhere to the 1953 armistice that ended the war on the Korean peninsula.
