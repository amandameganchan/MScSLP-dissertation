# ORIG TITLE    Hopkins plays Hitchcock . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Anthony Hopkins plays film legend Alfred Hitchcock in the Sacha Gervasi-helmed movie Hitchcock, which explores the period in the director’s life when he was trying to get Psycho made. Anthony Hopkins said: “It’s about his wife and his relationship, his personality and their combination, her support of him, her brilliant editing techniques, her knowledge of film, her advice to him – how she guided him because he needed guidance – but it so happened that ‘Psycho’ brought them closer together because he took a terrible risk: mortgaging his house – everything they had, everything made work for all the years and she said, ‘Let’s go ahead and do it.’ That made for a great love story.” . Helen Mirren plays his wife Alma Reville, herself an astute filmmaker. She said: “It’s about a creative partnership – the creative partnership between Alfred Hitchcock and Alma Reville and it’s to reveal that to the audience. It’s something that very few people know about. Ultimately it’s about that relationship, but it’s not meant to be an historic documentary or anything like that. It’s an imaginative film. It’s a movie as Alfred Hitchcock would say. It’s only a movie.” . Hitchcock also stars Scarlett Johansson as Psycho star Janet Leigh and opens in the UK this week.
