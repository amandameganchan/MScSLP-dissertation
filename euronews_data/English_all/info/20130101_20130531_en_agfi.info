Top fashion model Adriana Karembeu agreed: “This is a mythical place. We love to see new movies, movie stars. It’s such a mix of glamour, beauty, creativity, imagination. If you can live it only for a moment you have a lifetime of memories to keep.” . Everything was laid on -.champagne, music, luxury canapés.
