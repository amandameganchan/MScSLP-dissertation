# ORIG CONTENT  Police in Sweden are investigating why a cleaner at a rail depot in a Stockholm suburb drove an empty train – with disastrous results. It smashed through station barriers, derailed and ploughed into a kitchen in a small apartment block. None of the five residents was hurt, but the driver herself has serious injuries. “I heard it and woke up. I thought it was thunder and that lightning had struck the house next door. There were flashes and a terrible bang,” said Gert Castenfors, a witness. The operating company says the train was started with the usual key to which cleaners should not have access. The building was evacuated. The woman, who had to be cut from the wreckage, is under arrest for causing “devastation endangering the public.” .
