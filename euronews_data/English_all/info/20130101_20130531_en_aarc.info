# ORIG CONTENT  Somali Islamic militant have sentenced to death a French intelligence agent they have been holding hostage for three years. It follows a failed bid by French armed forces to rescue Denis Allex on Saturday. But French authorities presume he was killed during the operation which also claimed the lives of two French commandos. In a statement on its Twitter account, Al Shabaab, an al Qaeda affiliated group, says it decision comes after what it called “exhaustive attempts at talks” over his release. In October, a video of a gaunt-looking Allex pleading with President Francois Hollande to negotiate his release and save his life appeared on a website used by Islamist militant groups around the world.
