# ORIG CONTENT  Protesters have defied a night time curfew in Ismailia on the Suez Canal. They are ignoring the state of emergency declared by President Mohammed Mursi as he tries to stop the surge of violence that has claimed more than 50 lives. The army has been deployed in Port Said, as well as in Suez. The government has also agreed a measure to let soldiers arrest civilians. “I’ve lost my son,” one woman wailed, “how can I get him back? He is sleeping now, none of this can bother him anymore.” . In Port Said, there are more ominous signs of just how far law and order has broken down. A sniper hidden in a building targeted people standing in the street. “They are attacking us because we want truth and justice,” says one man, holding up what appeared to be empty bullet casings, “these officials who push for oppression, they only care about their position, not the blood of our martyrs” . Euronews correspondent in Port Said Mohammed Shaikibrahim says the atmosphere in the three Suez Canal cities is like a maelstrom, but is worst in Port Said. People say this is not about politics, but about revenge for the curfew and the football violence death sentences at the weekend.
