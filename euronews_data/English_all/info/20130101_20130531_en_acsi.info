# ORIG CONTENT  Spanish workers at Iberia have been protesting at Madrid’s Barajas airport as part of a strike over job and pay cuts at the loss-making airline. It comes after theowner – International Airlines Group, which includes British Airways – said it will press ahead with plans to axe nearly 4,000 posts. It is the second of three five-day stoppages planned for February and March. Iberia said most passengers have been re-scheduled but the action has had a big impact on others. It is thought the strike will ground nearly 1,300 flights this week. The February and March strikes are the biggest in the airline’s history and are estimated to be costing Iberia three million euros a day, while also causing disruption to other airlines as ground staff are part of the stoppages.
