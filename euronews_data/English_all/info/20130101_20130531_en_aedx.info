# ORIG CONTENT  Fears are growing in China after the bird flu virus was found at more markets in Shanghai. At least six people have already died and at least 16 have been infected in the east of the country. Authorities have slaughtered over 20,000 birds at the Huhuai live poultry market in Chinaâ€™s comercial capital, Shanghai. The H7N9 virus was found near the original area where it was discovered in pigeons earlier this week. The new strain of bird flu does not appear to be transmitted from human to human. Authorities in mainland China and Hong Kong have said they are taking extra precautions. Shanghai has banned all live poultry from other parts of the country. The outbreak has had an effect across the globe with airline shares dropping in value in Europe and Hong Kong over fears the virus could spread overseas.
