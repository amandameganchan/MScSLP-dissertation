# ORIG TITLE    Morsi not to appeal against election suspension . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi says he will respect a decision to suspend next month’s parliamentary elections. The Cairo Administrative Court says new electoral laws need to be reviewed by a higher court. Morsi says he will not appeal. It means the vote is likely to be delayed. He announced last month that the elections for the People’s Assembly would take place in four stages over two months, starting in April. The main opposition parties had threatened to boycott the ballots. They claimed the system gave an unfair advantage to the president’s allies, a claim Morsi denied. Egyptians voted in December in favour of a controversial new constitution which requires elections be held within two months.
