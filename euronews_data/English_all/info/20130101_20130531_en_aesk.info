# ORIG TITLE    Scary Movie 5: a sequel too far? . 
# ORIG CONTENT  “Frightenly unfunny”, is how one critic describes the fifth film in the Scary Movie franchise. A couple – played by Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan – are attacked in their home by paranormal forces after they bring baby home from hospital. With the help of a team of experts they find out they are being stalked by a demon. Actress Molly Shannon explained why the movies have been so popular: “I think people really know that they love to make fun of stuff. These movies are so popular with teenagers. People want to be in them because David Zucker is so talented, and Malcolm (Lee) directed them. It is just fun. “A lot of these people can do these parts in a day or two days, they will just shoot them out really fast. I think Lindsay (Lohan) and Charlie (Sheen) probably came and shot that in one day. It is easy. Fly in, fly out, have a little Japanese food when you are done shooting. See ya later. It’s fun “ . Other celebrities in the latest installment of the spoof franchise include Mike Tyson and Snoop Dogg. Actress Ashley Tisdale danced her way through ‘High School Musical,’ but said her comedic leading role in ‘Scary Movie 5’ was much harder: “It is just a different type of comedy than what I am used to. I am used to sitcoms. With spoofing a movie you have to take it really seriously. This is the best part, if the joke doesn’t work they rewrite the scene right there on the set.” . Scary Movie 5 is already on general release in the UK.
