# ORIG TITLE    Ailing Wiggins ruled out of Tour de France defence . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Bradley Wiggins will not defend his Tour de France title because of injury and illness. The Briton was also forced to withdraw from the Giro d’Italia in May with a chest infection and has been struggling with a knee problem, which has prevented him from training properly. “It’s incredibly sad to have the reigning champion at Team Sky but not lining up at the Tour,” Team Sky principal Dave Brailsford said in a statement. “But he’s a champion, a formidable athlete and will come back winning as he has before.” . Team Sky had already announced that their challenge will be led by Chris Froome, last year’s Tour de France runner-up. The 28-year-old Froome has been in good form this year, winning the Tour of Oman, the Criterium International and the Tour of Romandie. But he will still have plenty of challengers in the Tour de France, with former champion Alberto Contador among his main rivals.
