# ORIG TITLE    Indian film stars flourish at Cannes Festival . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Familiar faces from the Indian screen have descended on Cannes for a gala dinner to mark the centenary of their country’s movie industry. The largest contingent of stars from the world’s most productive film industry have travelled to the world’s leading cinema showcase on the French Riviera to promote their work. “Lunchbox” is one of four Indian films being screened at Cannes, although none are in the two main competitions. Stars also showed up for the screening of the latest Coen brothers film. “Inside Llewyn Davis” chronicles the life of a struggling musician in the early 1960’s folk scene in New York. It is the first of five US entries at the festival. Euronews correspondent Fred Ponsard said the Coen brothers’ film was very well received by the critics. Oscar Isaac is already being tipped to win Best Male Actor at the festival, he added, as his portrayal of the character Llewyn Davis is convincing. A darker tone seeped through in the Sunday premiere of “Borgman.” Alex Van Warmerdam’s tale of criminals who infiltrate the lives of a well-to-do family is the first Dutch film in 38 years on the main competition slate.
