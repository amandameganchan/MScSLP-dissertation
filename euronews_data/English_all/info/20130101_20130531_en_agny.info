# ORIG TITLE    ‘God particle’ pioneers share Asturias Award for Science . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The 2013 Prince of Asturias Award for Technical and Scientific Research has been bestowed on two individuals and an institution. President of the jury Pedro Miguel Echenique, made the announcement: . “The discovery of the Higgs boson is an emblematic example of how Europe has led a collective effort to solve one of the deepest mysteries of physics.” . And the winners are English physicist Peter Higgs, the Belgian Francois Englert and CERN, The European Laboratory for Particle Physics. Together they have developed the theory and practice to demonstrate the existence of the Higgs boson particle, the elusive ‘God particle’, which physicists have spent the last 40 years searching for. The Higgs boson explains how certain particles gain mass, mass is what makes up any object. If there was no mass all fundamental particles that make up atoms would simply whizz around at the speed of light and would not have gathered to from matter. It is an extra special day for Peter Higgs, as the scientist is celebrating his 84th birthday.
