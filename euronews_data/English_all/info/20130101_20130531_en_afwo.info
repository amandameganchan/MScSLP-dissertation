# ORIG TITLE    Auf Wiedersehen Thomas Schaaf . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Thomas Schaaf is no longer coach at Werder Bremen. After 14 years at the helm, Schaff and Bremen have parted ways by mutual consent, according to a club statement. His ties with Werder stretch back to 1972, when he joined as an 11-year-old before embarking on a 17-year playing career at the northern German club. Schaaf took over as head coach in May 1999 after training the clubâ€™s youth teams for a decade. Schaaf was the longest-serving active coach in the Bundesliga. He led Werder to the 2004 German league and Cup double. The club struggled this season and only secured Bundesliga safety last week. Assistant coaches Wolfgang Rolff and Matthias Hoenerbach will lead the team for the season finale in Nuremberg on Saturday.
