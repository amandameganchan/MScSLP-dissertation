# ORIG CONTENT  US Secretary of State John Kerry is trying to improve the relationship between Pakistan and Afghanistan, where NATO troops will leave at the end of 2014. Kerry met with Afghan President Hamid Karzai, Pakistani Army Chief General Ashfaq Kayani and Pakistan’s Foreign Secretary Jalil Jilani in Brussels. “We are delighted to be here to have a continuing trilateral discussion with respect to the security and other issues regarding the relationships in the region as well as the road forward heading towards 2014,” said Kerry. The border between Afghanistan and Pakistan is over 2,600 kilometres long and militants often cross over, carrying out attacks in both countries. There has been years of tension and stalled peace efforts between the neighbours, with Kabul accusing Islamabad of supporting Taliban fighters. Pakistan denies the claims and says it is Afghanistan that is giving aid and refuge to militants.
