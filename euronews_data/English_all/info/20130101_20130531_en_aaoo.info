# ORIG TITLE    Costa Concordia memorial events held in Italy . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Survivors of the Costa Concordia shipwreck joined relatives of the 32 people who died to mark the passing of a year since the tragedy. The stricken liner still lies on its side just off the italian island of Giglio. Part of the rock that tore a 230 foot long hole in the ship and became embedded in the hull has been returned to its position underwater with a plaque attached. A memorial inscribed with the names of those who died has also been unveiled on the quayside. Fog horns and sirens rang out in memory of those who died. Officials say it could be September before the ship is salvaged.
