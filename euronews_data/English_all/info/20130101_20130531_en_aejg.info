# ORIG TITLE    Lenders consider seven year extension for Portugal loan repayments . 
# ORIG CONTENT  International lenders have recommended that Portugal should get an extra seven years to repay loans to the European Union. The move would offer a significant boost to Lisbon as it tries to push through a series of difficult spending cuts. The extension is also being considered for Ireland which got an emergency loan in 2010 a year before Portugal. By extending the maturity the payments are spread over a longer time, reducing the burden on the economies. EU ministers are set to meet in Dublin on April 12 and 13 to discuss the extensions, with a formal decision expected next month. While it is thought that Ireland will get full support, backing for Portugal is expected to be conditional on the country plugging a 1.3 billion euro gap in its 2013 budget, which arose after the constitutional court rejected four of Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelhoâ€™s planned austerity measures. He will now have to make alternative cuts to the health, education and welfare budgets to keep the Troika on side.
