# ORIG CONTENT  As Stockholm wakes up after a fifth consecutive night of rioting, questions are increasingly being asked about the root causes. A police station, schools and cars in several surburbs of the Swedish capital were the latest victims of Thursday night’s public disorder. Stockholm is one of the richest cities among countries that are part of the international economic organisation – the OECD. However, Sweden has the the fastest growing inequality of any OECD nation. Some 15 percent of Sweden’s population is foreign-born. Immigrant communities are the worst affected by youth unemployment and poverty. Although the Nordic country is known for its generous welfare system, benefits have been reduced and taxes lowered during the seven years centre-right Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt has been in charge. In addition, anti-immigrant party the Sweden Democrats are third in the polls ahead of a general election next year.
