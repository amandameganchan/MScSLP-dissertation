# ORIG CONTENT  Thousands of Pakistani Shi’ites have taken to the streets in protests over increasingly deadly attacks from hardline Sunni groups. In the latest incident on Saturday 89 people were killed near a market in the southwestern city of Quetta. Protesters say it highlights the government’s failure to crack down on militancy. Rizwana, the sister of a man killed in the attack said: “Everyone is not safe here, even a child is not safe here, even not a woman is safe here. So what is our fault? What have we done wrong here? We just only want peace. We have got two demands: army should come here, and targetted operation against militants should be started.” . Lashkar-e-Jhangvi said it was behind Saturday’s attack, just as it claimed responsibility for another bombing that killed nearly 100 people in the same city last month. The group is trying to destabilise the government’s ties with the United States and install a Sunni theocracy. Pakistanis in other major cities, including Karachi, brought traffic to a standstill in their demonstrations.
