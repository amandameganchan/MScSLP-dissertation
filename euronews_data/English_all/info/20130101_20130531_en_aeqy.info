# ORIG TITLE    Thatcher funeral held in London . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The funeral at St Paul’s Cathedral of Britain’s longest-serving prime minister of the 20th century, and its one and only woman premier, Margaret Thatcher has concluded in London. The Falklands war leader’s coffin was carried on a gun carriage in a procession from Westminster and then borne by military servicemen. Even though she was given military honours and the Queen attended, this was officially called a ceremonial funeral rather than a state affair. The political elite and dignitaries from around the world joined the Thatcher family and some 2,300 mourners in paying last respects. Prime Minister David Cameron, the current leader of Thatcher’s Conservative Party, read at the more than hour-long service, as did Thatcher’s granddaughter Amanda. Cameron dismissed criticism – given that the controversial 1980s reformer was far from universally loved – about the cost and scale of the event. Thatcher was a Methodist. She will be cremated later and her ashes laid beside those of her husband Denis.
