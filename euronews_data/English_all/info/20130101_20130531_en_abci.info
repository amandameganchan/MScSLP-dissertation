# ORIG CONTENT  Fresh clashes broke out in Cairo on the eve of the second anniversary of the Egyptian revolution which led to the downfall of Hosni Mubarak. This time the violence was directed at the country’s first freely-elected leader, Mohamed Mursi. Police used tear gas against protesters, as activists accused the president of betraying the goals of the Arab Spring uprising. Political uncertainty and an economic crisis have undermined support for the country’s transition. Mursi has also been accused of failing to deliver on election promises. Security issues and fuel and food shortages still frustrate many Egyptians. Further mass protests are expected across the country on Friday, with large rallies in Cairo’s Tahrir Square and outside the presidential palace.
