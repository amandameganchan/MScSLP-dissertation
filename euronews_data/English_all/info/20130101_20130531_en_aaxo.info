# ORIG TITLE    Charles Taylor appeals war crimes in the Hague . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Ex-Liberian president Charles Taylor could face a tougher sentence as his appeal is heard in the Hague. Prosecutors have asked for his 50 year sentence to be extended to 80 years. Mr Taylor had attempted to appeal the original verdict at the UN backed special court in the Hague. His lawyers claimed the conviction was plagued with inconsistencies. The prosecution countered that there was evidence of his direct involvement in war crimes. Last May he was found guilty of aiding and abetting war crimes in Sierra Leone where Taylor received the infamous “blood diamonds” in exchange for arms. Over 50,000 people were killed during the civil war in Sierra Leone. He is the first ex-head of state to be convicted since the Nuremberg trials after World War II.
