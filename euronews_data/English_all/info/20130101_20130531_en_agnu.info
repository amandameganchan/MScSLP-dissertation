# ORIG CONTENT  South Korea has suspended operations at two more nuclear power reactors and extended the closure of a third after it was found that cables had been supplied using fake documents. After testing the cables failed to meet proper performance levels. Han Jin-hyun, Vice Minister for Trade, Industry and Energy said: “We expect unprecedented supply shortage this summer as we have to meet power demand while three reactors are halted.” . The timing could not be worse as South Korea enters its hot summer when power demand for air conditioning is highest. Last year two other nuclear reactors were closed after a similar scandal, adding to public worries about nuclear safety. South Korea’s president has pledged a thorough investigation.
