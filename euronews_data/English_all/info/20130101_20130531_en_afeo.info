# ORIG TITLE    India: Five year old rape victim dies . 
# ORIG CONTENT  After nearly two weeks in hospital, a five year old girl raped in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh has died of her injuries. The victim had been in a coma since April, 20 after her attackers attempted to suffocate her. She suffered a heart attack and passed away on Monday night. The young girl is believed to have been lured to a farm while her parents were working and raped by one of their friends. “The law should give him the harshest punishment. He should be burnt alive so the entire world can see how such a criminal should be punished and that would make criminals shake in fear,” said the dead girl’s mother. Police have arrested two men in connection with the attack. This is one of three high profile cases involving the rape of girls in India aged between four and six.
