# ORIG CONTENT  Coalition talks are underway in Israel, after a general election produced deadlock between the right-wing and centre-left blocs. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud remains the largest party grouping in parliament. But its base has been eroded by newly-formed centrist party Yesh Atid – which means ‘There is a Future’ – led by former television presenter Yair Lapid. The party, only formed last year, stunned observers by securing second place. Lapid has said he will only participate in a government committed to reviving peace talks with the Palestinians. David Ricci, Professor of Political Science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said: “We do not think that Lapid is going to make trouble for Netanyahu in the area of foreign policy, because I think everyone assumes that some kind of negotiations will open.” . But overcoming political divisions at home will be no easy task. Shelly Yachimovich of the Labour Party, which came third, says she does not want to be part of a coalition led by Netanyahu. And the biggest upset was for nationalist leader Naftali Bennet, who was tipped for great success before Lapid stole the show. Analysts predict weeks of horse-trading before a new cabinet is formed.
