# ORIG CONTENT  In the Domiz refugee camp in Northern Iraq, where music succours the tens of thousands of refugees, an elderly man sings in Kurdish: “Until I die, I will never forget what it’s like to be a refugee”, the music carried on the wind that whips up stinging sand and tears at the makeshift shelters. With four million Syrians homeless, either in Syria or one of its neigbouring countries, the World Food Programme is warning of an impending disaster. “Here’s the camp, there’s our tent. When the wind came it blew inside our tent; the tent was collapsing. When it rains our tent is flooded,” said 10-year-old Alaa. Four countries with problems of their own, Iraq,Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan are now bearing the heavy burden of coping with the influx of extra mouths to feed. And that influx is growing. “WFP needs funding immediately in order to meet the needs of the people in April and in May, and actually for the rest of the year. On a weekly basis, the World Food Programme needs 18 million dollars to feed 2.5 million people inside Syria and the refugees in neighbouring countries,” says the WPF’s regional Emergency Coordinator in Syria and Neighbouring Countries, speaking in Jordan. While the UN can access the refugees that have fled Syria, those trapped inside face an even worse situation, as the UN can only get to those in rebel-held areas.
