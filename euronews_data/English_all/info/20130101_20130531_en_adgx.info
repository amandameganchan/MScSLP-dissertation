# ORIG TITLE    Pope charms journalists in first media test . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Hard nosed journalists perhaps more known for their cynicism were won over by a papal charm offensive as a relaxed Pope Francis joked with them during his first meeting with the media. After he explained his choice of name was in tribute to Francis of Assisi who represented poverty and peace, journalists queued up to meet the new papal superstar. Likewise Dan Mannarino from New York was impressed: â€œI think he was a much more animated Pope Francis this time around compared to Wednesday night where I think he was a little terrified when he came out on the balcony. This time he was making jokes, he was laughing and he also told the story of why he chose the name Francis.
