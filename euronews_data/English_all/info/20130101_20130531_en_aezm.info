# ORIG CONTENT  Hundreds of thousands made homeless by the earthquake which struck Haiti three years ago are now facing eviction from their emergency shelters. According to a damning report by Amnesty International, 65,000 people have been illegally removed from camps since 2010. It appears landlords are getting impatient with tents pitched on their property. One of the report’s authors Chiara Liquoria, a Caribbean researcher at Amnesty International, spoke of the level of intimidation camp dwellers faced. “These people have been victimized for months with the threat of being evicted. Sometimes they are being attacked by uniformed officers and sometimes plain clothes people in the middle of the night who arrive with knives and matches and destroy the tents.” . Three years on from the disaster, 320,000 people remain in camps. The report claims that the government has condoned evictions. Justice Minister Jean Sanon said the government was against forced evictions. He also reminded the police not to get involved in forced expulsions. “The police are supposed to be there to protest and to serve,” he added.
