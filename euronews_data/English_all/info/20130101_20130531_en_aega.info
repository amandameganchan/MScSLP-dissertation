# ORIG TITLE    Korea: war talk tension clouds the facts . 
# ORIG CONTENT  There is confusion surrounding whether or not North Korea is preparing for a fourth nuclear test. Earlier reports suggested increased activity around the North’s main underground test site. It now appears that that is not the case. The lack of clarity does little to diffuse the tension on the Korean peninsula as North Korea continues its war rhetoric. Kim Min-seok, from South Korea’s defence ministry said: “We all know about the possibility that North Korea would fire a ballistic missile, so we are closely monitoring with the US the North’s movement and the chances of a ballistic missile launch.” . China, one of North Korea’s few allies, has called for peace in the region. Japan meanwhile said its armed forces have orders to shoot down any North Korean missiles en route to its territory. The UN slapped further tough sanctions on Pyongyang last month following a third nuclear test. North Korea responded by stepping up its bellicose language against Seoul and the US. In another development the North has now pulled out all its workers from the shared Kaesong industrial complex.
