The figures come from Italy’s Interior Ministry. It is feared bad weather will keep people home. However, the turnout figures for regional elections, such as Lombardy, are more encouraging. Some voters are desperate for change, including one woman in Milan who said: “I hope everything goes well, because otherwise we are going to get worse.” . Referring to the effect the election will have on the country’s economic situation, a voter in Milan was pessimistic. “I see instability for the next two years and on Tuesday the markets will react negatively,” he said. Exit polls will come out soon after voting ends on Monday at 14:00 local time and official results are expected by early Tuesday. Markets and other EU member countries will be waiting to see who Italians want in charge of the eurozone’s third largest economy.
