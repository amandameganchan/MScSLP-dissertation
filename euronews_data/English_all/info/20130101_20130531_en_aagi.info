# ORIG CONTENT  Police in Northern Ireland brace themselves for a fourth night of clashes stemming from protests about the removal of the British Union flag over Belfast City Hall. Around 70 people have been arrested during the last few weeks in what has been described as the provinceâ€™s worst tension in a decade. Although fireworks, bottles and bricks were thrown at officers, the trouble was not on the scale of the previous night. Earlier on Sunday church leaders, local politicians and community workers met for more than three hours to discuss ways to end the violence. Police are now blaming pro-British paramilitary groups for hijacking the protests. On Saturday night officers came under attack with petrol bombs and gunfire.
