# ORIG TITLE    Sly is back in ‘Bullet to the head’ . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Sylvester Stallone goes back to his action movie roots in ‘Bullet to the Head’. He plays a hitman who teams up with a young Washington DC detective in a high-stakes investigation that takes them from the mean streets to the corridors of power in New Orleans. The unlikely duo, brought together by two vicious murders, take on all who stand in their way, willing to sacrifice everything to exact revenge. The movie had its world premiere in New York, where Sly was clearly delighted to be back in the spotlight and bossing a movie single-handed . “Even modern films are a throw back, it’s just their re-interpretation of them. But we said, let’s go back to like Heinz 57, let’s go back to the original format, you know, baked beans, keep it simple. And that’s what I like to do, it’s what I understand. But you bring in some new blood like Jason Momoa and this fellow here and you just see what happens,” he said. Stallone’s partner in the movie is played by Sung Kang. The American actor is best known for the film ‘Better Luck Tomorrow’ and his role as Han Seoul-Oh in the ongoing ‘Fast and Furious’ franchise. Stallone’s rival in the film is played by Jason Momoa who became internationally known for reviving ‘Conan the Barbarian’ in 2011, the 1982 role that started Arnold Schwarzenegger’s career. He said it was an honour to learn from the veteran Stallone during filming: “He was just really giving, so I had a great time just learning and listening. It was a good time to just shut up and just listen to someone who is just very experienced. I really respect him as a director and a writer. He’s a self-made man, you know what I mean?” . Veteran action specialist Walter Hill directed the film from a screenplay by Oscar nominee Alessandro Camon (‘The Messenger’), based on Alexis Nolent’s French graphic novel “Du plomb dans la tête”. Good ol’ Sly is still as fresh as boxer Rocky Balboa or the soldier John Rambo. At 66-years-old he still does most of his own stunts, and boy, does he love it, as will his fans.
