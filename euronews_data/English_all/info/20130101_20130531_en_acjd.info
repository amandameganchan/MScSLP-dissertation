# ORIG TITLE    ‘Twilight’ savaged by ‘Razzie’ awards ahead of Oscars . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Popular vampire saga “Twilight” swept the board at the Golden Raspberries, which “award” bad movies and performances, on February 23. The final “Twilight” film “Breaking Dawn: Part 2” was given seven prizes, known as “Razzies”, a day ahead of the Oscars ceremony in Hollywood. Although the movie was panned by critics, it made more than 600,000 euros at the global box office. Industry experts say the February 24 Oscars ceremony is one of the most unpredictable in years, with no one film likely to sweep all the big prizes. Daniel Day-Lewis may make Oscars history if he wins Best Actor for his portrayal of Abraham Lincoln in Steven Spielberg’s “Lincoln”; he would be the first person to win the award three times. Austrian drama “Amour” is a strong contender for Best Foreign Film, after it was a winner at the Independent Spirit awards on February 23. Michael Haneke’s film is about how an elderly couple cope after the wife suffers a debilitating stroke.
