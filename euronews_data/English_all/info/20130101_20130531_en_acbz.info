# ORIG CONTENT  Celebrations marked the homecoming of Venezuela’s cancer-stricken president Hugo Chavez on Monday. But while there was much merriment on the streets of Caracas, big questions remained about their leaders’ health. Just back from a fourth round of surgery in Cuba, Chavez who is 58, was taken straight to a military hospital in the capital. He is now expected to stay home for the remainder of his treatment. Vice President Nicolas Maduro says he will give more information about Chavez’ condition soon. Despite several long trips to Cuba for treatment since June 2011, Chavez was re-elected to a new six-year term in October. But his inauguration has been postponed indefinitely. One Caracas resident, Maria Ortega, was relieved that Chavez was back home: “I love him very much, I ask my God to heal him and he will come out of this because he is a fighter.” . Another local resident said: “Venezuela waits for you with open arms, my commander. We love you. We want you and there is an entire population that will support you, always, until 2021.” .
