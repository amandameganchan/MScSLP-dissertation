# ORIG TITLE    UK govt stumbles again in Qatada deportation case . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The British government has had yet another legal setback in its long-running attempt to have the radical Muslim cleric Abu Qatada thrown out of the UK. In its submission to the Appeal Court, the Home Office legal team described him as a “truly dangerous” individual who has only escaped expulsion because of loopholes in the law. London’s Appeal Court recognised that he is viewed as ‘very dangerous’ but added that in a legal context that was irrelevant. Successive UK governments have tried to have Abu Qatada deported to Jordan where he was convicted on terrorism charges in 1999. His lawyers have argued successfully that his re-trial there might not be fair because of evidence obtained under torture. The UK government said it would appeal again.
