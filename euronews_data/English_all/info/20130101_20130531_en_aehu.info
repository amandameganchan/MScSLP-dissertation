# ORIG TITLE    No show for DPRK workers at Kaesong . 
# ORIG CONTENT  North Korean labourers did not report for work at the Kaesong industrial zone a day after Pyongyang said it would withdraw all 50,000 of them and suspend operations indefinitely. After weeks of threats against the US and South Korea, the North seems determined to shut down its last remaining major project with Seoul. Kim Hyung-suk of the South Korean Unification Ministry which is responsible for relations with Pyongyang said: . “North Korea’s unilateral decision to push ahead with this measure cannot be justified in any way and North Korea will be held responsible for all consequences.” . Amid one of the the worst crises since the 1953 armistice, which the North now says it has torn up, officials of the South Korean companies operating the complex held an emergency meeting in Seoul. They have called for talks to try to reopen the site. Closing Kaesong will harm the South Korean economy, but the impoverished North will be hit far worse.
