# ORIG TITLE    Heads turned at Chinese and Russian fashion weeks . 
# ORIG CONTENT  As part of China Fashion Week, a home-grown makeup and styling show has been held in Beijing and the designs on display were eye-catching, if not head-turning. Chinaâ€™s most famous makeup artist Mao Geping included metallic pyramid studs, gold-plated and crystal jewelery and bronze trinkets in the makeup designs. Meanwhile, not to be outdone, Moscow has been holding its own Fashion Week. Valentin Yudashkin was inspired by Russian winters for his autumn/winter collection which featured silk, Persian lamb and mink, and was inspired by the patterns of snowflakes.
