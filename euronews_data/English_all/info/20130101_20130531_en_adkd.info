# ORIG TITLE    London Eye gets first deep clean since 2000 . 
# ORIG CONTENT  It has been a landmark in the UK capital since the millenium, but the London Eye has never had a deep clean until now. On the evening of March 19, a team of abseiling cleaners from Karcher started removing more than a decadeâ€™s worth of grime. The job will take three weeks. The work will take place at night and the Eye will operate as normal during the day.
