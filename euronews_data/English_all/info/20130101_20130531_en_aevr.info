# ORIG CONTENT  Indian police have arrested a second man in connection with the rape and torture of a five-year-old girl in New Dehli. Police say the child was abducted on Monday last week and kept in captivity by two men in the basement of the building that she lived in with her family. Neighbours say they found her two days later after hearing her cries. The case has reignited popular fury over widespread sexual violence. The anger echoes the response to the gang rape of a 23-year-old trainee physiotherapist on a bus in December. She later died of her injuries. Protesters are angry authorities have failed to prevent more such crimes. Media reported several other attacks on children over the weekend, including that of a nine-year old girl in the north-eastern state of Assam, who had her throat slit after being gang-raped.
