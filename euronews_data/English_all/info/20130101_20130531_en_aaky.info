# ORIG CONTENT  Slovenia won their first ever team ski jumping world cup event on Friday after leaping to the top of the podium in Zakopane, Poland. In the second of six team competitions this season the Slovenian quartet of Jaka Hvala, Peter Prevc Jurij Tepes and Robert Kranjec sealed the win after earning at total of 963,5 points. Polandâ€™s foursome led at the halfway stage on their own hill and were looking good for victory with two jumps left. However a poor second effort from Mietus paved the way for Slovenia who took full advantage to claim the historic win and silence the partisan crowd. Poland finished second 9.1 points behind. Austria, without newly crowned Four Hills champion Gregor Schlierenzauer, rounded off the podium in third place. The Austrians, who were second in the first team event in Kuusamo Finland in November, finished with 931.1 points. Kuusamo winners Germany were a distant fourth.
