# ORIG CONTENT  Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has warned Israel the Islamic Republic would take military action if its nuclear infrastructure came under attack from the Jewish state. Thousands gathered in Maschad chanting, “Death to America” after President Barack Obama on his trip to the Middle East had said “America will do what we must to prevent a nuclear Iran”. The crowd heard a clear warning from Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. “Sometimes the Zionist regime threatens us, threatens to launch a military attack, but I think they also know themselves, and if they don’t know, they should know, that if they make this mistake, the Islamic Republic will raze Tel Aviv and Haifa to the ground,” he said. Iran has been seen flexing its military muscle in a series of exercises recently as Israel has repeatedly hinted at a pre-emptive strike against it arch enemy. Talks on Iran’s uranium enrichment programme are set to resume next month.
