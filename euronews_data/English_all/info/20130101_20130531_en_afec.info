# ORIG TITLE    Soprano Brightman aims even higher . 
# ORIG CONTENT  If everything goes as planned, British soprano Sarah Brightman will be the next paying passenger to ride a Russian rocket to the International Space Station. The 52-year-old wants to make the journey in 2015 and would be the first paying customer since Cirque du Soleil founder Guy Laliberte who donned a red clown’s nose during his 2009 trip. To help mark the occasion the performer has just released an album titled ‘Dreamchaser’, which is a reflection of her future voyage to space. “It’s called ‘Dreamchaser’ for a reason, in that I really have been chasing a dream since I was a little girl and the idea of exploration and space. And finally that maybe coming to fruition,” she explained. Brightman rose to fame starring in the original London and New York casts of “The Phantom of the Opera.” She visited Russia about a month ago and received the approval of a medical commission to begin training at the Cosmonaut Training Centre outside Moscow after rigorous testing. While in orbit Brightman hopes to become the first professional artist to record a single in space. For now she is busy with the promotion of her new CD. “As well as having a beautiful soundscape that suggests space to us. It also suggests other things to do with hope and human kind. And, you know, all of those warm feelings that we get when we think about the universe,” she said. As an ambassador for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation, (UNESCO), Brightman hopes her experience will be useful in encouraging females to enter the field of science. Sarah’s new album is now released worldwide and her world tour kicks off in June. Sarah Brightman's web site .
