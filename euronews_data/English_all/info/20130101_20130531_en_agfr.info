# ORIG CONTENT  The rescue operation after Monday’s gigantic tornado in Oklahoma City is almost over, according to officials. Nine children are among the two dozen known to have died when the apocalyptic storm hit the suburb of Moore. Local fire chief Gary Bird says emergency teams have left nothing to chance: “We started with a primary search yesterday and a secondary search. We made it through, I would say, most of the structures, most of the vehicles, most of the homes, but the ones that we didn’t make it through yesterday, we will make it through today for sure, and a second and third time. We will be though every damaged piece of property in this city at least three times before we are done.” . They have continued to pull survivors from ruined buildings throughout the day. The death toll has been revised down from 51 after initial confusion over numbers, as State Governor Mary Fallin explained: . “We know that bodies have been taken to the medical examiners office, but we have also heard that there may be bodies that were taken to local funeral homes. We are working real hard right now to try to get a more accurate count of the loss of life and we hope to have better numbers on that”. The damage from Monday’s tornado is likely to cost more than the twister in Missouri in 2011 that killed 158. The final bill there topped three billion dollars, or just over two billion euros.
