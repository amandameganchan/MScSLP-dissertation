# ORIG TITLE    Pavlyuchenkova wins Portugal Open . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova recovered from a slow start to beat Spain’s Carla Suarez Navarro in the final of the Portugal Open on Saturday and claim her first title under new coach – five-time grand slam champion Martina Hingis. After dropping an early service game the 19th ranked Russian soon found herself trailing her opponent 2-4 in the first but as nerves suddenly got the better of Suarez Navarro, Pavlyuchenkova picked up her game to win it 7-5. The Moscow native then ran away with the match comfortably winning the second set 6-2 for her fifth career title and second of the season after victory in Mexico last month. Suarez Navarro meanwhile was left suffering her second consecutive defeat in the final of the Portuguese clay court event after also losing last year’s showpiece match against Kaia Kanepi.
