# ORIG TITLE    Hollande in Mali: French troops will not stay . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The French president was greeted by jubilant crowds for a second time in Mali, when he arrived in the capital Bamako. Francois Hollande was visiting the country where French troops have deployed to drive out Islamist groups linked to al-Qaeda. His forces have been fighting for three weeks alongside Mali’s army. In Bamako, Hollande said: “France has no intention of remaining here in Mali because it is Malians themselves, Africans, who will achieve security, independence and sovereignty in Mali. This is how I see Franco-African relations: respectful, democratic and transparent.” . Mali’s interim president touched on allegations of atrocities carried out by the country’s troops. Dioncounda Traoré said: “In the euphoria of newfound liberty, do not give in to excess, false generalisations and the reflex of revenge.” . Earlier, residents in Timbuktu unleashed a similarly enthusiastic welcome on Francois Hollande after French troops led the liberation of the remote city in the desert. After months of occupation by radicals, who enforced a strict interpretation of Islam, they showed off their brightly coloured clothes and jewellery. There are 3,500 French personnel deployed in Mali – 800 moved on Timbuktu, including airborne troops who parachuted onto nearby dunes. Hollande also saw ancient texts at the city’s library that had survived a fire set by Islamists as they were routed.
