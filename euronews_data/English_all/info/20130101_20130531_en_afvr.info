# ORIG TITLE    Another day, another strike in Greece . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Greeks have become used to strikes and industrial action and Tuesday saw a fresh protest, although this time it’s not about austerity. Civil servants have taken to the streets angry at what they see as government authoritarianism. A teacher’s strike called for Friday over new contracts has been banned by the government invoking emergency powers. Teachers who do strike could be sacked. For many Greeks this smacks of the bad old days of the country’s history. Retired bank employee Vasslis Pappavassiliou said: . “This is unconstitutional and unacceptable, this should not happen, people must react, they must fight together to oppose this…. We are talking about a new junta, just like the one between 1967 and 1974”. Teachers demonstrated on Monday about the new contracts, under which they’ll have to work two extra hours a week to bring them up to the European average. Meanwhile 4,000 teachers will be transferred to remote areas of Greece to plug staffing gaps.
