# ORIG TITLE    Iran’s Ahmadinejad in Egypt on historic visit . 
# ORIG CONTENT  President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is on the first trip of an Iranian head of state to Egypt since Iran’s 1979 revolution. As he left the plane he was met by Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood President Mohamed Mursi. It is a visit that would never have been possible under Egypt’s former leader Hosni Mubarak who maintained close links with America and the West. The two leaders are expected to discuss the Palestinian situation after Ahmadinejad told Beirut-based TV station Al Mayadeen that “the political geography of the region will change if Iran and Egypt take a unified position on the Palestinian question.” . The Iranian leader also said he would like to visit the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian territory which neighbours Egypt to the east and is under the control of Islamist movement Hamas. Later this month, Iran will address concerns over its disputed nuclear programme at talks with world powers to be held in Kazakhstan.
