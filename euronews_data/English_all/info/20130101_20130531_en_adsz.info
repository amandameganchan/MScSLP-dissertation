# ORIG TITLE    Street fighting rages in Homs . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A video posted online by the Sham News Network, purports to show fighting in Homs, Syria. The network describes itself as an anti-Assad group with no opposition affiliations. It says the video shows government soldiers being captured by a group of Baba Amr revolutionaries, who are then handed over to a larger group from the Free Syrian Army. Meanwhile there was also reported shelling in several parts of Damascus as the Assad regime used its usual tactic of making up for shortfalls in ground troops by pounding rebel-held areas with indirect fire and air strikes.
