# ORIG TITLE    Lebanon Prime Minister and cabinet resign . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The prime minister of Lebanon Najib Mikati has carried out his threat to resign. His government has also stood down after a cabinet split on the approval of a commission to oversee planned elections in June. The government failed too to back the PM in his bid to extend the term of the head of the country’s internal security forces. “I announce the resignation of the government in the hope it will make the main political blocs aware of the need to fulfil their responsibilities and demonstrate a cohesion so we can avoid the unknown in Lebanon,” he said. Mikati was appointed premier in 2011 after the Shi’ite group Hezbollah and its allies brought down the then unity government. He has had to deal with sectarian tensions on the back of the conflict in neighbouring Syria. It’s unclear if the president has accepted his resignation.
