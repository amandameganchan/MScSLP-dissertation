# ORIG CONTENT  Runners at the London Marathon held a 30-second silence to honour the the victims of the Boston bombings. Around 36,000 runners took part in the first major world marathon since two explosions near the finish line in Boston killed three people and wounded 176. Police increased the number of officers by 40 percent, they say to reassure the large crowds who had gathered rather than because of any perceived threat. Marathon runner, Angie Bainbridge, said she did hesitate but in the end decided to take part: . “It was quite worrying obviously and I was a bit nervous about it, but my daughter said ‘would we still run?’ And I said I’m going to, if she decided she wasn’t then I’d understand, but she said ‘No, solidarity we’re going to go for it.” . Fellow runner, Paul Faulkner added: . “It made me strong and i feel that I definitely had to run today for the Boston people. I have friends over in Boston and they were there on the day running as well so certainly, this is for you guys. “No more hurting people” . Sunday also saw the inaugural West Bank Marathon. The Palestinian Olympic Committee says around a thousand runners ran the course, running four laps around Bethlehem. Some of them wore T-shirts in memory of the Boston victims, David Awad a runner from Beit Sahour, in the West Bank said: . “When I heard about it in the news (the Boston attack) I was really saddened by the death of eight-year-old Martin, so I wanted to have this shirt, Martin will be with me throughout this race, so this is Martin over here, this is his quote “no more hurting people”.
