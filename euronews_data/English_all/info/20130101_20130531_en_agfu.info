# ORIG TITLE    Seventh day of Cannes Film Festival . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The seventh day is traditionally one of rest, but not on the Croisette in Cannes. Halfway through the 66th film festival in the French Riviera town, celebrities came out in their droves to tread the red carpet. Euronews correspondent Fred Ponsard says the race for the Palme D’Or is back on with the screening of two films that have charmed festival goers. “There was thunderous applause for Paolo Sorrentino’s “La Grande Bellezza” while Steven Soderbergh’s “Behind the Candelabra” heralds the glittering return of Michael Douglas alongside Matt Damon in one of the best roles of his career.” he says. The film chronicles the life of Liberace, the best-paid showman in the United States in the 1960s, famous for his performances with piano and candelabra. Paulo Sorrentino’s Fellini-esque “La Grande Bellezza” is from an entirely different genre. It portrays the moral decadence of a certain strand of Italian society while paying homage to the physical splendour of Rome.
