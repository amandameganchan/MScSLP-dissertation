# ORIG CONTENT  Police in the UK are treating the sudden death of the exiled Russian tycoon Boris Berezovsky as ‘un explained’. An investigation has been launched after the 67-year-old’s body was found in the bath at his home outside London. A wanted man in Russia and an opponent of President Vladimir Putin, it is said Berezovsky was paranoid about security after having survived several assassination attempts. Once a friend of the Kremlin he later fell out with Putin. He had made his fortune from selling cars but used his connections at the end of the Soviet Union to become one of Russia’s first oligarchs. Having made numerous enemies he later moved to London. But his wealth had recently diminished after several court cases particularly after losing a 3.5 billion euro damages claim against Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich. Sources close to Berezovsky claim he was depressed after the court case and under financial pressure.
