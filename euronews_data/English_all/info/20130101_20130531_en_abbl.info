# ORIG TITLE    UCI wants ‘truth, reconciliation’ . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The International Cycling Union’s independent commission into the Lance Armstrong affair began an extraordinary meeting in central London on Friday. The central issue facing the commission is whether to include a process of truth and reconciliation during its inquiry, to persuade riders to come forward with information without the fear of being punished. Among those to arrive at the Law Society building was UCI president Pat McQuaid who told journalists that the amnesty programme would need to be approved by the World Anti-Doping Agency. So far WADA has said it would not cooperate with the independent commission because of concerns about its terms of reference and ability to carry out its role without undue influence.
