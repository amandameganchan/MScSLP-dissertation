# ORIG TITLE    American Catholics happy with papal choice . 
# ORIG CONTENT  With Catholicism now the number one religion in the United States there was a buzz over the election of Pope Francis like none before, and the fact he is from the Americas was also seen by some at the USA’s biggest Catholic church in Washington as maybe a sign of things to come. “Perhaps we are not ready yet for an American pope, but I think we have so many talented American cardinals that that might be a possibility in the future,” said one young priest. “I’m a young guy from New York, a Dominican brother now. I did have some hopes for Cardinal Dolan. But being a Catholic, part of the church throughout the world, I am happy that we have a pope,” said another young man. “We were just really excited, really joyful that God has given us such a simple, humble man to serve the people of God,” was another’s opinion. Both Cardinal Dolan and Boston’s Cardinal O’Malley were media darlings in the run-up to last night’s vote, even if American Catholics themselves have not been especially active on social networks. Furthermore, their criticisms of the church have been more and more outspoken after years of financial and abuse scandals in Los Angeles, Boston, Chicago and elsewhere. “As President Obama remarked, the selection of the first pope from the Americas speaks of the strength and vitality of the entire continent. It’s a big day for the western hemisphere and a big day for millions of Hispanics in the United States,” says euronews’ Stefan Grobe.
