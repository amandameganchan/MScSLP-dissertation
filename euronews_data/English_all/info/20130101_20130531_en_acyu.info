# ORIG CONTENT  Syrian rebels have been facing several important issues in their fight against the forces of President Bashar Al Assad, most notably the short supply and poor condition of weapons available to them. The recent American announcement to send aid to rebel controlled areas has been criticized by those fighting the regime for not including weapons. Washington fears that weapons could fall in to the hands of radical Islamic groups. Friday saw protests across Syria against the regime like this one in Aleppo. Separate calls were made by Islamic groups to take to the streets with the opposition clearly divided. FSA supporters and the Al-Nusrah Front were both present. “We will have another revolution afterwards to get rid of these people. Our revolution is suffering because of radical Islamic,” said FSA fighter Abou Yassar. The Al-Nusrah Front clearly have a different vision for Syria. “I hope that after the war, Syria will become an Islamic state,” Hamza Royal, an Al-Nusrah rebel explained. Meanwhile, the Syrian population is waiting patiently for less violent methods to install a new political system.
