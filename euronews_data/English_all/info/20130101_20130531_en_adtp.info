# ORIG CONTENT  Italy’s centre-left leader Pierluigi Bersani has failed in a last-ditch attempt to form a coalition government to rule the country. Bersani, whose alliance fell short of the majority it needed to govern after last month’s election, has made no headway after five days of talks with rival parties. “I told the president that (my attempt) . had not found a solution and at this point the president decided to immediately verify the situation himself,” Bersani told reporters after an hour long meeting with Napolitano. President Giorgio Napolitano may now opt to appoint a technocrat government like that of outgoing Prime Minister Mario Monti or a broad cross-party coalition.
