# ORIG CONTENT  Youths have thrown rocks and other missiles at police for a second night running in a suburb of Stockhom. Around 100 of them came out on the streets and targeted officers and their cars. The unrest was in Husby, a low income neighbourhood, home mainly to first or second generation immigrants where around a third of school children leave education with low grades. Ten cars were set ablaze and one fireman was injured when he was hit by a rock. The police eventually made six arrests. “They light a fire somewhere and the fire service goes to the scene of the fire. The police have to escort the fire engines and the stone throwing starts again, “ said police spokeswoman Diana Sundin.
