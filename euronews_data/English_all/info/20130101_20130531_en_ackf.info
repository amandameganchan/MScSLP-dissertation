# ORIG TITLE    Horsemeat forces meatballs off the menu at IKEA . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The Swedish furniture giant is the latest company to fall foul of the horsemeat scandal. Meatballs have been pulled from their shelves after Czech inspectors discovered traces of horse DNA. The batch in question was produced by a single Swedish supplier, Familjen Dafgard. IKEA has said that the meatballs should only contain beef and pork, and has vowed to carry out tests on their popular product to see if horsemeat is present. The presence of horse in popular beef products has created widespread consumer concern. Josef Duben from the Czech Veterinary Authority said there was no cause for people to worry: “It doesn’t mean that these products are hazardous to people’s health, but this is false labelling, meaning that the horsemeat was used as a cheaper replacement for beef or some of it was mixed into the product but not declared.” . EU agriculture ministers met in Brussels to discuss ways to restore consumer confidence in the region’s complex food industry. Country of origin labelling is amongst the proposals on the table in Brussels.
