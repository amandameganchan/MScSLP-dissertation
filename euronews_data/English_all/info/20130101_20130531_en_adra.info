# ORIG TITLE    Wedding March marks day one of USA gay marriage hearing . 
# ORIG CONTENT  In an unconventional Wedding March, protesters for and against gay marriage have been making their voices heard outside a historic hearing at the US Supreme Court in Washington. It marks the opening of a two-day hearing into the legitimacy of a ban by the state of California on same-sex couples tying the knot. Known as Proposition 8, it overturned a previous ruling allowing nuptials between gay partners. Its constitutionality is in question. Anti-gay marriage protesters petitioned the Supreme Court to review the case as they want individual states to be able to define marriage as a union between a man and a woman. At the hearing Justice Kennedy has raised concerns that the ban could impact on the lives of gay couples’ children. He is considered to be a swing voter in the decision-making process. He added that the court was entering “unchartered waters” on issues dividing the states. Nine states in America allow same-sex couples to wed, and President Obama’s administration has asked for the ban to be struck down. The court could choose to uphold the ban, quash or invalidate similar bans in other states. It could also rule that California’s law was unconstitutional. The final decision is expected in June.
