# ORIG TITLE    Berlusconi fires on Italian justice over his tax fraud conviction . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Thousands of Silvio Berlusconi loyalists have held a rally in the northern Italian city of Brescia to protest against his recent conviction for tax fraud. Addressing the largely partisan crowd, the former prime minister and media mogul lambasted Italy’s judiciary which has upheld a four-year prison term. “The state of our justice system doesn’t guarantee the impartiality of judges and often tramples on the right of freedom of each citizen. It interferes in the life of politics and it wants to eliminate me!” Berlusconi told the Freedom People party faithful. But some of Beppe Grillo’s anti-establishment 5-Star movement who were also there, claim Berlusconi is using delaying tactics and parliamentary privilege to avoid going to jail. One Grillo supporter said : “Silvio was condemned and he must wear these pyjamas,” holding up a photo with Berlusconi wearing prison uniform. While many of his supporters however claim all the charges against him are unfair and disproportionate against one man. But tempers between the two sides boiled over at one point as one detractor said, referring to Berlusconi ‘s so-called ‘bunga bunga’ parties, “your orgies are numbered”.
