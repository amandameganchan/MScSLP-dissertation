# ORIG TITLE    Thousands for the chef and the food’s not cheap either . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Europe maybe in recession but a meal for four with celebrated chef Ferran Adria of the elBulli restaurant has sold online for a stomach churning 18,000 euros. That does not include the food, just the company of the legendary chef. The buyer from Asia will dine in Adria’s brother’s restaurant in Barcelona. Another chance to eat with the chef will go under the hammer in New York at the end of April.
