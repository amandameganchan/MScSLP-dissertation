# ORIG CONTENT  Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev has been buried in a Muslim cemetery in Virginia. It took a week for authorities to find a resting place for the ethnic Chechen who along with his brother is suspected of setting off the bombs that killed three on April 15th. Officials from Caroline County near Richmond in Virginia, where the cemetery is located, said they were reviewing the burial to see if it was legal. The Graham Putnam and Mahoney funeral home where Tsarnaevâ€™s body had been kept in Massachusetts had faced protests as it struggled to find a cemetery willing to permit the burial.
