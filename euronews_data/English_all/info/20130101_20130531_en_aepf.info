# ORIG CONTENT  Organisers of the London Marathon confirmed the race will go ahead as planned on Sunday despite the bomb attacks near the finish line of the Boston Marathon on Monday that killed three people and wounded more than 100. Britain’s Sports Minister Hugh Roberston added he was confident of security arrangements for the London event and encouraged people to attend as a show of solidarity with the U.S. city. “In security terms, we are as confident as we possibly can be that we can deliver a safe and secure marathon,” Robertson said in an interview with British media. President of the Tokyo Marathon meanwhile expressed his sadness over the tragic events in the US but insisted the bombings would not deter people – especially the Japanese – from running in overseas events. Koji Sakurai said: “It is tremendously sad that the accident happened but I think the passion Japanese have for running will remain the same and we will continue to participate in marathons overseas.” . Marathon officials from across the globe will gather in London next week for the World Marathon Majors meeting where security will most certainly now be top of the agenda.
