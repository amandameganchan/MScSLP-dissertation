# ORIG TITLE    Spanish doctor sentenced . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Spanish doctor Eufemiano Fuentes, the central figure in the Operation Puerto cycling doping probe, was found guilty of endangering public health and given a one-year suspended jail sentence on Tuesday. The 58-year-old, who was accused of supplying anabolic steroids, and transfusion equipment to athletes, was also barred from medical practice in sports for four years. Fuentes testified that he tended to athletes in other sports, like football, tennis, boxing and track and field. But it is unlikely that the names of those athletes will ever be revealed. The court also sentenced former cycling team official Ignacio Labarta to four months in jail and acquitted the other three people on trial: Yolanda Fuentes, Manuel Saiz and Vicente Belda.
