# ORIG TITLE    WADA calls UCI ‘deceitful’ in doping probe . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The World Anti-Doping Agency has accused the International Cycling Union of being “deceitful” for claiming both would be working together on a truth and reconciliation process. WADA announced on Wednesday that UCI had “again chosen to ignore its responsibility to the sport” by disbanding the panel looking into claims that cycling leaders helped cover up Lance Armstrong’s suspicious doping tests. UCI president Pat McQuaid issued a response to the WADA statement, which he called “blatant and aggressive misrepresentations,” and urged their President John Fahey to set aside his apparent “personal vendetta and crusade against cycling’‘ and support the truth and reconciliation commission.
