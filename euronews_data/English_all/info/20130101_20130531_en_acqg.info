# ORIG CONTENT  Speculation continues over the health of ailing Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. He is said to be receiving treatment for cancer in a Caracas hospital but he has not been seen in public for weeks. Speaking after a Catholic Mass late Friday in which prayers were said for the leader’s health, the country’s Vice President Nicolas Maduro countered rumours that Chavez was dead. But a lack of transparency from the Venezuelan government over the president’s health has caused unease in the country. Adding to the tension dozens of anti-government students chained themselves up in public to demand proof the president is alive and in Venezuela. Chavez was re-elected for another six-year term in October but his swearing-in has been delayed due to his ill health. According to the constitution elections must be held within 30 days if there is an “absolute absence” of the president.
