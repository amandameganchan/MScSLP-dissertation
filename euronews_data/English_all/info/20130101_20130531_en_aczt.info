# ORIG CONTENT  As 115 cardinals gather in the Sistine Chapel on Tuesday for the start of the conclave – they will be choosing the man who will lead the Catholic Church and 1.2 billion Catholics all over the world. One German tourist at Vatican City said: “I find it all very solemn and touching and I hope that we will get the right Pope.” . Although it is seen as unlikely, some American Catholics wonder if the Archbishop of New York Cardinal Dolan has a chance. One American priest asked about him said: “Yes, he is beloved around the entire world and specially in the United States.” . When asked if he wants the next Pope to come from the United States, he answered that he would like: “Whoever God wills for next Pope to be.” . One Italian man said: “I don’t believe (in God) very much to tell the truth, but I think the Pope should be followed like people followed John Paul II.” . From Vatican City euronews correspondent Simona Volta said: “While the number of favourites to become the next Pope seems to get smaller, people in St Peter’s Square will look to the small chimney on the roof of the Sistine Chapel to see, probably by the end of the week, who will be the one to succeed Benedict XVI.” .
