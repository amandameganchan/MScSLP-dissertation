# ORIG CONTENT  Countries across Latin and South America are paying tribute to Hugo Chavez, the region’s political strong man. Bolivia’s Evo Morales called Chavez “A brother in solidarity, a revolutionary comrade, a Latin- American who fought for his country and the greater nation just like Simon Bolivar. He gave his life for the liberation of the people of Venezuela,” he said, “all the Latin American countries and for all anti imperialists around the world.” . Despite their ideological differences, Brazil’s Dilma Roussef was magnanimous.“The Brazilian government has not always agreed with his politics, but today we recognize that Chavez was a great leader.” she conceded. Columbia’s Juan Manuel Santos also paid tribute to what he said was a political and personal loss. “It’s a big loss for the Venezuelan people and for the region – for Columbia and for me in particular.” .
