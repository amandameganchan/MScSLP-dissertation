# ORIG TITLE    Belaid burial sparks violence in Tunis . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Violence has marred the funeral of assassinated Tunisian opposition leader Chokri Belaid. The shooting of the secular politician has plunged the country deeper into political chaos. Clashes erupted close to the Tunis cemetery as police fired tear gas at protesters who hurled stones and set cars alight. The authorities said around 100 people were arrested. As many as 50,000 turned out to mourn Belaid’s passing. Since former dictator Ben-Ali was ousted from power in the first revolution of the Arab Spring, tensions between the Islamist government and its secular opponents have grown. Chokri Belaid’s killing has sent shockwaves through the country, which hitherto had experienced a relatively peaceful transition to democracy. Banks, factories and shops closed in Tunis and other cities in response to a strike called by unions to condemn the killing.
