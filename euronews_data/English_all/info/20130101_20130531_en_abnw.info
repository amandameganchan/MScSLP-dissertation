# ORIG CONTENT  New video footage has revealed the harsh conditions that Syrian refugees are enduring within the country’s borders. More than a million people are estimated to be internally displaced. At one camp, 40 kilometres from Aleppo, more than 11,000 people are struggling with a lack of food and shelter. More than 5,000 refugees have arrived in the last few days. The UN humanitarian office is preparing for a big spike in the number of refugees as the civil war escalates. Meanwhile Syria’s opposition is ready for talks with the regime, but leader Moaz Alkhatib says President Bashar al-Assad must step down as a precondition for negotiations. Assad has previously refused to have dialogue with people he calls traitors or “puppets made by the West.” . A Syrian newspaper with close links to the government quotes a source within the regime saying the offer was “two years late”. The source also questioned opposition leader Alkhatib’s role as negotiator. Fierce battles erupted once again in Aleppo on Tuesday as rebels fought government troops near an army barracks, according to activists. Once Syria’s thriving commercial capital, several areas of the city have been completely ravaged by war.
