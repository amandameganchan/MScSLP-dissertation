# ORIG TITLE    The race for the Palme D’Or gets underway at Cannes . 
# ORIG CONTENT  French director Francois Ozon had the privilege of seeing his film get the official part of the Cannes film festival underway. “Jeune et Jolie”, which is a coming-of-age tale starring actress Marine Vacth, was the first of 20 films to be shown competing for the event’s coveted Palme D’Or award. Once again the atmosphere may have been a bit damp due to rain but enthusiasm abounds with many praising the diversity of films on show. Our reporter Fred Ponsard said: . “The Cannes Film Festival has well and truly started with the first two competition films honoured on the red carpet. In fact that race is wide open with the screening of both the Mexican film by Amnat Escalante called “Heli” along with Francois Ozon’s – and this is only day one of the competition!” . Sophia Coppola’s “The Bling Ring” launched the other popular “Un Certain Regard” section of the festival which presents films with all kind of visions and styles. “The Bling Ring” is based on a true story and sees Harry Potter star Emma Watson play a member of a group of teenagers who, in 2009, robbed the homes of LA celebrities. What would Hermione have thought? .
