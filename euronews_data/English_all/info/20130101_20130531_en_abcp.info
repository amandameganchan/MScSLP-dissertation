# ORIG TITLE    Unrest continues in Egypt after days of violent protests . 
# ORIG CONTENT  In the aftermath of Friday’s violent demonstrations, protestors lingered on the streets of Cairo on Saturday morning, throwing stones and tear gas. Outside the presidential palace, barricades prevented anyone from getting in. In Tahrir square, opponents of the President returned to their camps. On Friday night, tens of thousands of protestors were forced out of the square after riot police used tear gas. Two years after Egypt’s uprising, demonstrators say President Mursi and the Muslim Brotherhood have hijacked the revolution and are forcing their Islamist agenda on the country. His backers say his critics do not respect the democracy that has given Egypt its first freely elected leader. Across Egypt on Friday, rallies by opponents of the President turned into clashes with security forces. Nine people were reported killed, most in the port city of Suez, where the army has also been deployed. Around 500 were injured nationwide. The President is due to meet later on Saturday with the National Defence Council to discuss the violence.
