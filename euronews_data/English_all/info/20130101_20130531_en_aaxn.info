# ORIG CONTENT  People in Kiev are marking Unity and Liberty Day, which symbolises the unification of Ukrainian lands. A human chain formed across the Paton Bridge, which spans the Dnipro river in the capital. The state holiday commemorates the 1919 union of the Ukrainian People’s Republic and the Western Ukrainian People’s Republic into a single Ukraine: . “Nothing splits Ukrainians – not language, not history. We’re united in everything. We’re being separated only by those who benefit from it before elections or those who find it’s an easier way to rule the country,” said one link in the human chain. The current WBO heavyweight champion boxer and politician, Vitali Klitschko, joined in the celebrations. Our correspondent in Kiev is Angelina Kariakina: . “Participants of this gathering at Kiev’s Paton bridge have agreed to leave any kind of political symbols behind. They say it’s the state rather than party flags that should be waved today” .
