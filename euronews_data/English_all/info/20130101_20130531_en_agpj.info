# ORIG TITLE    Bechtel bites off more than it can chew with Transylvanian highway . 
# ORIG CONTENT  It is a road to nowhere, being abandoned only 13% complete and at great cost to the Romanian government. The Romanians hired America’s Bechtel 10 years ago to build 415 kilometres of motorway, but the 2003 contract was revised and renegotiated to death, delaying work, and resulting in Romania paying for more than half of the total cost, over one billion euros, most of it in penalties. “The sum Romania has to pay Bechtel amounts to approximately 30 million euros, plus VAT. This clears the road ahead and frees us from obligations so that we can plan a strategy for the Transylvanian road network,” said Prime Minister Victor Ponta on Thursday as the two sides finally settled the break of contract conditions. The 30 million represents the final payment for work actually completed, but the country is left with 52 kilometres of finished, half-finished or barely begun motorways.
