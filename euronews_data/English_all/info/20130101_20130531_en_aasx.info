# ORIG TITLE    Is the mafia’s dirty money being laundered in Romania? . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Using waste to launder dirty money. That’s what Italian prosecutors believe is going on Romania. The money in question is the so-called treasure of one of Sicily’s most powerful mafia bosses, former Palermo mayor Vito Ciancimino. Prosecutors in Italy believe the company running Europe’s largest landfill site, on the outskirts of Bucharest, acts as a front for Massimo Ciancimino, Don Vito’s son. And it is a lucrative business. Massimo Ciancimino is at the heart of a major investigation by the Italian judiciary, which has so far failed to prove any links between these Romanian companies and the heir of Don Vito’s fortune. Euronews speaks to him and others involved in this case, as we try to get to the bottom of this treasure mystery.
