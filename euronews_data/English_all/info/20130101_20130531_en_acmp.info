# ORIG TITLE    Italy’s Grillo says no to vote for centre-left government . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Beppe Grillo, the leader of Italy’s newest and now largest political group, has ruled out voting for any government led by the traditional parties but says he could back individual laws. His 5-Star Movement holds the balance of power in parliament after Italy’s inconclusive election but Grillo, 64, appears to have closed the door firmly on working with centre-left coalition leader Pier Luigi Bersani. On his blog, the fiery comedian mocks him as a “dead man talking” and accuses Bersani of making “indecent” proposals to his anti-establishment movement. The centre-right leader Silvio Berlusconi has been mostly silent over the election result – perhaps because the only path back to power without Grillo lies in doing another deal with the centre-left, something Italians have shown they do not want repeated. According to Rome resident, Maria Petriccione: “There’s not much hope for Italy if 30 percent of people still vote for (Silvio) Berlusconi, this is what I have to say. It could be good if the Democratic Party makes an alliance with the 5 Star Movement, because it is a new force, young.” . Sentiments shared by another Roman Grazia Marciano: “I hope Grillo’s people will give a hard time to our old politicians, I feel it’s a difficult situation, but not impossible. Let’s hope the general situation will improve.” . Now, not just Italians, but also foreign leaders worried by the election outcome in the euro zone’s third largest economy, are asking themselves what Grillo will do next.
