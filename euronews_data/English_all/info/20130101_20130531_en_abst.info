# ORIG CONTENT  Tunisia is facing one of its toughest days since the 2011 revolution as the political crisis deepens. Bloody protests which rocked the country since Wednesday are set to continue to mark the funeral of assassinated opposition politician Chokri Belaid. In response to the murder, Prime Minister Hamadi Jebali called for the dissolution of parliament and the appointment of a technocrat government. However, all three ruling parties rejected the plan until new elections could be held. The main trade union has called for a general strike, setting the stage for further confrontation. University lectures have been suspended over the weekend and many shops have closed in apprehension of continued violence. If no agreement is found over a new technocrat government, analysts fear that the civil unrest will continue to a level that cannot be contained.
