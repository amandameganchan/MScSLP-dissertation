# ORIG CONTENT  Nine-times Olympic gold medallist Carl Lewis said this week he hoped Japan would win the right to host the 2020 Olympics. Widely regarded as the one of the world’s greatest athletes Lewis is visiting Japan to support children in tsunami-devastated areas. But whilst in the region the four-time Olympian took a trip down memory lane and visited the Yoyogi National Stadium where he set three world records at the world Championships in 1991. Lewis reflected: “I have obviously tremendous memories of that and that was without question my best track meet ever, so let’s just start with that, and the fact that I had the best long jump of my career and the best 100 metres and was able to win three gold medals. Just tremendous, but for me it was more fitting because Japan had been the one place I’ve been to the most in my career, they’ve been the most supportive in my career outside the United States.” . Japan’s sports authorities have offered to demolish the stadium, which served as the main venue for the 1964 Summer Olympics, and replace it with a new futuristic stadium ready for the 2019 Rugby World Cup and for the 2020 Olympic bid. Lewis was enthusiastic about the plans and said: “Japan has always been a high-tech community and I think it would be a showcase, probably more high-tech than any stadium that’s ever been made, and I think it will be a great place to be. I will be at the 2020 games wherever it is, and I hope it’s here.” .
