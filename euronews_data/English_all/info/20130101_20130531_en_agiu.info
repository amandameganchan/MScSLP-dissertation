# ORIG CONTENT  London’s calling for Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund and all their travelling fans as the two Bundesliga clubs arrive in the English capital for the Champions League final at Wembley. Both sides have taken this season’s edition by storm leaving the competition’s traditional heavyweights in their wake. The stage is now set for the first ever all-German Champions League final. Bayern are hunting their fifth champions league title – they won the European Cup three years on the trot from 1974 and once more in 2001. Frustratingly for the Bavarians though, they have lost two of the last three finals – in 2010 against Inter and last season’s finale against Chelsea at their home Allianz Arena. And outgoing coach Jupp Heynckes believes going one step further to lift the trophy this time will be a career highlight for his players – especially the veterans in his squad. He said: “We have a generation of players who are a little bit older, 28-29, 30-years-old. For those players it will be the top of their careers to win this title at Wembley against a another German team.” . Borussia Dortmund are playing the showpiece match for the first time since 1997 – which was their only other appearance in the European Cup final. In a major blow to their title hopes Dortmund’s star playmaker Mario Gotze – who will Join Bayern in the summer – has been ruled out with a hamstring injury. Nonetheless coach Jurgen Klopp believes it’s all about the tactical decisions made on the night that will make the difference. The media-friendly Klopp said: “I dont think it is important how is the strongest in which part of the game. This is a game you can win with the right decision at the right moment. Both teams are very strong and that is the reason we are here.” . Airports across the capital have been bracing themselves for the arrival of the German masses for the historic event. Extra staff have even been taken on in some airports to deal with the influx. Twenty-five thousand tickets were on offer to both sets of supporters but thousands more without tickets are expected to descend upon the capital.
