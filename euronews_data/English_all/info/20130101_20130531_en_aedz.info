# ORIG TITLE    Leak at Fukishima . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Japanâ€™s Fukushima nuclear power plant may have leaked contaminated water from a storage tank into surrounding ground, according to the Tokyo Electric Power Co. The power company has not yet discovered the cause of the leak, which has been found in one of seven tanks that store water used to cool the reactors. 13,000 cubic metres of water still in the affected tank is expected to be pumped into other vessels over the next two weeks. They are located just 800 metres from the coast. The operator of the Fukushima Daiichi plant has faced several problems with controlling ground water and maintaining the large cooling system built to keep the reactors stable. The facility was the site of the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in March 2011 when a magnitude 9.0 earthquake triggered a tsunami that caused extensive damage to the plant.
