# ORIG TITLE    Gbagbo before ICC . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Former Ivory Coast leader Laurent Gbagbo has appeared at the International Criminal Court in The Hague at a hearing to decide whether or not he should face trial for crimes against humanity. Gbagbo is accused of starting a civil war when he refused to step down in 2010 having lost the presidential elections. Reflecting the divisions which remain within Ivory Coast, outside the courtroom around 300 protesters demanded that the charges should be dropped. Around 3,000 people are estimated to have died during the 2010 4-month civil war in Ivory Coast, which also saw around 1 million people displaced. The conflict ended when French troops intervened, Gbagbo was arrested and election-winner Alassane Ouattara took over the presidency.
