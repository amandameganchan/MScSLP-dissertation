# ORIG TITLE    Man appears in court in London for Lee Rigby killing . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A man has appeared in court in London charged with murdering an off-duty soldier in the street. Michael Adebowale appeared for a brief hearing during which he was remanded in custody on charges of murder and possessing a firearm. “The 22-year-old appeared in the dock wearing handcuffs and flanked by police officers, which is very rare at a court appearance in the UK. His hand was bandaged. He only spoke to confirm his name, his date of birth and his address. Adebowale is due back in court on Monday, before appearing at the Old Bailey Central Criminal Court at the end of June,” reported euronews’ Ali May in London. Adebowale is the younger of the two alleged attackers. The second, 28-year-old Michael Adebolajo, remains under arrest in hospital. Flowers have been piling up at the scene of the broad-daylight assault of 25-year-old Drummer Lee Rigby since his death a week ago, transforming a section of the street into a memorial to the Afghan veteran. A minute’s silence was held at the scene on Wednesday.
