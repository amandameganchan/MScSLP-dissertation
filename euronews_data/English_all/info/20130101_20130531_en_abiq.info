Brandishing the NGO’s most recent annual report at a press conference in Moscow, HRW Deputy Director Rachel Denber reserved her harshest words for the period since Putin returned to power.

Grievances include the arrest of members of rock group “Pussy Riot” for staging a protest at a Moscow cathedral and a new law prohibiting the promotion of homosexuality. HRW: The Day After .
