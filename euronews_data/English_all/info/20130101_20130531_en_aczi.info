# ORIG TITLE    EU extends ban on animal-tested cosmetics . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A full ban on cosmetics that have been tested on animals entered into force across the EU on Monday. The ban, announced by the European Commission, extends previous restrictions and now outlaws the sale of products tested on animals outside Europe. Firms had gotten around an earlier ban by having tests carried out outside the EU, and therefore out of regulatorsâ€™ reach. The EU banned animal testing of finished cosmetic products since 2004. The ban on cosmetics containing animal-tested ingredients was first agreed in 2009. Yet many loopholes remained in place after intensive lobbying by the cosmetics industry. However, products that use ingredients tested on animals before the ban can remain on the shelves.
