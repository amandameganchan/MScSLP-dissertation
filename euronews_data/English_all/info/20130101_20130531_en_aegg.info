# ORIG CONTENT  Swiss Journalists have reported disgraced formed French finance minister, Jerome Cahuzac, could have stashed away 15 million euros in a foreign bank account. Cahuzac was forced to resign after admitting hiding 600,000 euros in a Geneva bank account but now it is looking like that could be just the tip of the iceberg. Swiss news anchor, Darius Rochebin, said: . “When Cahuzac tried to leave the UBS bank, he visited private banks, concerning a sum of approximately 15 million euros. “What’s certain is that the minimum deposit for a Singaporean account would require much more than 600 000 euros. “One would need to be placing more than a million euros, and some say two or three million.” . It is claimed the Swiss bank refused to accept the funds fearing future complications as Cahuzac was a political figure. This scandal has sparked one of the biggest political crisis in decades in France, even leading some to declare the contract between the people and government is now broken.
