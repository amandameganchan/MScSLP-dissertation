# ORIG TITLE    Australian police claim record drug bust of crystal meth . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Australian police say they have seized a record haul of the drug methamphetamine. The illicit substance, known as ice, was smuggled into Sydney hidden in shipments of chemicals from China. Detectives estimate the 585 kilograms intercepted would have fetched around 440 million euros on the street. The capture follows a four month long investigation but only a call from a member of the public about suspicious activity at a storage activity in the suburb of West Ryde allowed police to make the breakthrough. “None of it would have happened if it wasn’t for one phone call from the community. That one phone call was the one thread that allowed us to pull and unravel a syndicate that will be stopped forever,” said New South Wales Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione. Australia is becoming an increasingly lucrative market for international drug networks because of the strength of the local currency. Police say three men, an Australian, a Singaporean and a Hong Kong passport holder, are now in custody and will appear in court today charged with attempting to possess the drug. If found guilty they face spending the rest of their lives behind bars.
