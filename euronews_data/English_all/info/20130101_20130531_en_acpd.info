# ORIG CONTENT  Tension was was in the air as the US’s new Secretary of State John Kerry met Turkey’s Foreign Minister on the American diplomat’s first official trip to a Muslim country. Recent remarks by Turkey’s prime minister in which he called Zionism a crime against humanity were firmly rejected. “ Obviously we not only disagree with it but we found it objectionable… but that said..Turkey and Israel are both vital allies of the United States and we want to see them work together to go beyond the rhetoric and begin to take concrete steps to change this relationship,” said Secretary of State Kerry. Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu responded by saying: “As a country, we have never expressed any hostile remarks against any other nation or country. If there is something hostile that needs to be mentioned, it is the time when nine Turkish people were killed in international waters without violating international agreements. This was a hostile act done by State of Israel.” . Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s comments are set to overshadow the trip. Kerry wants the visit to cement Turkish /American relations over the conflict in Syria.
