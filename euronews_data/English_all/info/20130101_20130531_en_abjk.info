# ORIG CONTENT  British Prime Minister David Cameron promised to help North Africa fight terrorism as he arrived in Algeria on Wednesday for talks on security cooperation. The visit came two weeks after the In Amenas hostage crisis which saw 37 foreigners killed including six from the UK. Cameron laid a wreath at the Martyrs Monument, which was built to mark Algeria’s war of independence from France between 1954 and 1962. He also vowed to work with other governments in the region to halt the growing threat from al-Qaida-linked militants in the region. “What is required in countries like Mali – just as in countries like Somalia on the other side of Africa – is that a combination of a tough approach on security, aid, politics, settling grievances and problems; an intelligence approach that brings together all the things we need to do with countries in this neighbourhood to help them; to make them safer, but to make us safer too,” said Cameron. On Tuesday, Britain promised to send military experts to Mali to boost French, African and Malian forces fighting an insurgency by Islamist rebels. Several hundred people were kept hostage during the four day siege at a remote desert gas plant. Although most were released, dozens were thought to have been killed as Algerian troops fought to retake the facility. British oil giant BP is among several operators of the gas field.
