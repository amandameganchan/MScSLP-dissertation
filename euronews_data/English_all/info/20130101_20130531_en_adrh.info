# ORIG TITLE    ‘Troika Go Home’: angry students protest Cyprus bailout . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Answering a call put out on social networking site Facebook, thousands of young people in Cyprus took to the streets to protest against the bailout accepted the government. Marching through Nicosia, the banners clearly show what they think of the deal struck with the EU, IMF and European Central Bank – known together as the troika. Some of them read: ‘Troika Go Home’, ‘Your mistakes, our future’ and ‘Merkel, Hitler – the same s***’ . Student Yannis who took part in the demonstration complained: “Obviously many of our parents will lose their jobs, all of us will lose income, some of us will even find it hard to go and study at university.” . Another student, Thomas, directed his anger at the troika, saying: “They’ve just gotten rid of all our dreams, everything we’ve worked for, everything we’ve achieved up until now, what our parents have achieved. Basically they’re just knocking down this country because they want to.” . An anti-austerity protest is being organised for Wednesday by the second largest party in Cyprus, the left-wing AKEL. The party says the bailout will deepen the crisis and accuse the troika of having a plan against the people of Cyprus.
