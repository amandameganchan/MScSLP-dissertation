# ORIG CONTENT  Resident’s of Brazil’s bustling financial capital, Sao Paulo, are being encouraged to slow down and enjoy some retro video games on a huge scale. The facade of a cultural centre has been turned into a 3,000 square metre screen where passers-by are challenged to play classic games such as Pac-Man, Tetris and a specially created version of Space Invaders. Sao Paulo student, Isabela Batista said: “It’s a lot pressure. Everyone on the street is watching, cheering, but it is really cool.” . The international group of digital artists behind the exhibit, entitled “Play” said they wanted to showcase the video game art of the 1970s and 80s as well as encouraging people to take a moment from their busy lives to enjoy themselves in the city centre. The exhibit was supposed to finish on Sunday but it has proved so popular that it has been extended until April 14.
