# ORIG TITLE    France: Battle over gay marriage continues . 
# ORIG CONTENT  It is an issue which has sparked some of the largest protests in the French capital in years. As the National Assembly votes on the gay marriage bill, thoughts in Paris are turning to the next step. The leader of the anti-‘Marriage for All’ movement, Frigide Barjot has vowed to continue the battle. “Today it’s a question of changing the anthropological design of reproduction. Common law won’t change that. The people must decide. In the meantime we are bringing it before the Constitutional Court and so we trust them to understand that the principle of sexual difference for procreation is a general principle of human rights.” . The fight is not over for the pro-‘Marriage for All’ camp either. The clause allowing sperm donations to lesbian couples was dropped from the bill. Aurélien Selle from Act Up said: “The law is just the first step. Equal rights to marry, that’s the bare minimum, as they also promised medically assisted procreation for female couples, meaning equal rights for all women. They said this would be part of a law coming later this year. But it’s a good first step that we can finally get married.” . Euronews correspondent Giovanni Maggi reports from Paris: “The approval of the ‘Marriage for All’ law is therefore not the end of the matter. The controversy risks becoming a long-running political battle.” .
