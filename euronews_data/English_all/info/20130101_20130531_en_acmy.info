# ORIG CONTENT  Following the meeting in the Kazakh city of Almaty, world powers have agreed to a follow-up expert-level meeting in Istanbul on March 18 and another round of political negotiations on April 5-6. The latest talks aimed to resolve international concern over Iranâ€™s nuclear programme. The US, UK, France, China, Russia, and Germany had offered to relax sanctions against Iran in return for a promise to halt uranium enrichment and to close the Fordo facility. Sanctions are choking the Iranian economy with oil revenues down and its currency more than halved. Iran argues that it has the right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes. It has been enriching to 20 per cent, a crucial step in developing weapons-grade material. This month Iran announced the discovery of a large uranium deposits and the expansion of its nuclear programme. Neighbouring Israel has hinted it would attack nuclear sites if diplomacy and sanctions fail.
