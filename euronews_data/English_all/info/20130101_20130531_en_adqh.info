# ORIG CONTENT  The Cyprus bank clean-up has begun, but there is a throbbing hangover to deal with after the country’s worst crisis in nearly 40 years. It is back to the drawing board for the island’s business model as an offshore financial centre, and in the wake of the turmoil privatisations, structural reforms and budget cuts look likely. “The decisions that were taken were harsh, it is a catastrophe. It will be a long time before things are right again,” predicted one man. “Its a big shame what has happened, but with the way things were going what else could they do? There was no other solution. God help us all,” said one woman. “We have learned to be scared, we have learned to panic, but now we have to learn to take things more easy, calm down and make more balanced decisions,” reasoned another man. It has been a baptism of fire for the recently-elected conservative government, which must now find a way to get Cyprus through the aftermath.
