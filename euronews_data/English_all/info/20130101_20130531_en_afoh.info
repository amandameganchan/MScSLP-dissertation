# ORIG TITLE    Italy collision ship captain investigated for manslaughter . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The captain of a container ship which crashed into a control tower in the Italian port of Genoa, is facing potential manslaughter charges. Reports quoting legal sources say he has been placed under official investigation. It is now known that at least seven people were killed. Two of the dead were coastguard officers and a third was a pilot for the port. The identity of the others is not known. It is thought more are still missing. “It seems that there were also some people in the lift, and the lift has not yet been found. It fell into the sea at night. The situation is… incomprehensible,” said Pierangelo Massa, Regional Secretary for the UIL union. The accident is thought to have happened as the Jolly Nero was being guided out of the port by two tug boats. Something went wrong and the container ship – more than 230 metres long and weighing 40,000 tonnes – rammed the tower, bringing it crashing down. Bruno Prinz was lucky. He explained how he was meant to work in the tower but was replaced after a colleague asked him to swap shifts. The colleague is seriously injured, one of four who were taken to hospital. The tower was more than 50 metres high, similar to a standard air traffic control tower at airports. More people were in it than usual because the accident happened as staff were changing shifts. Now all that is left of the tower is a stricken stairway, leaning at an angle. Investigators say there is no logical explanation for the collision as sea conditions were optimal.
