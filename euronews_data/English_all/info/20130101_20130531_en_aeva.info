# ORIG TITLE    United celebrate their 20th in style . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Manchester United are the English champions for the 20th time after their demolition of relegation-threatened Aston Villa 3-0 on Monday night. Robin van Persie raised the roof of Old Trafford with a first-half hat-trick, scoring his first after just less than a minute and a half as the Villa defence flailed at a looping cross that was passed back across the goal for the simplest of far-post tap-ins, the other brace coming from a glorious volley and a close-range shot.
