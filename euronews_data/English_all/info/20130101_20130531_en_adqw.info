# ORIG TITLE    Turkey gets its way on normalising Israeli relations . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Turkey and Israel are talking again following Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s telephone apology last week in the wake of President Barack Obama’s visit. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan told his AK party that an apology for the deaths of nine Turks during the 2010 Gaza flotilla incident was just a start. “I have mentioned many times before that this apology won’t bring our martyrs back, it won’t recover the embargo over Palestine which has been enforced for decades. But this apology is very important for our martyrs and Palestinian brothers’ blood,” he said on Tuesday. With negotiations now underway for compensation for the families of the nine dead, and the lifting of Israel’s embargo on Gaza under discussion, Turkey’s two other conditions for re-normalising relations with Tel Aviv, Erdogan said he would visit Gaza in April. Israel has asked him to hold off on the visit, while it waits to see if all remains quiet on the Gaza front before lifting the embargo, and an Israeli paper says Obama is trying to persuade Erdogan that it is too soon for a Gaza visit.
