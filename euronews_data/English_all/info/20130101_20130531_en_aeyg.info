# ORIG TITLE    Fraud trial resumes for Russian opposition leader . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Russia’s opposition leader Alexei Navalny has returned to the dock in Kirov to answer new fraud charges. Navalny, who is one of the country’s most vocal Kremlin critics, is accused of embezzling 400,000 euros from a state timber firm he advised four years ago. His reappearance in court comes after he went on trial last week on theft charges – another case he says is built on lies as part of a Kremlin campaign to crush the opposition. Inside the court, Navalny told reporters he is launching an appeal. He dismissed the charges as inaccurate and said they cannot be presented in their current form before a court of law. Navalny, 36, denies any wrongdoing. He is facing a total of four criminal trials and could be jailed for up to ten years if convicted.
