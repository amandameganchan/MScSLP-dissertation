# ORIG TITLE    The highs and lows of Oscar Pistorius . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Born without a fibula in either leg in 1986, Oscar Pistorius underwent a bi-lateral below the knee amputation just before his first birthday. “The fastest man on no legs” exploded on to the world stage in 2004 with victory in the 200-metres final at the Athens Paralympics. He began to run against able-bodied athletes in South Africa until the International Association of Athletic Foundations banned him from competing, claiming his artificial legs gave him an unfair advantage. He appealed at the Court of Arbitration for Sport and won his case. A multiple Paralympian Gold medalist Pistorius achieved his dream when he qualified to compete in the 400-metres at London Olympics, the first double amputee to do so. Pistorius is the face of Paralympic sport, his image endorses countless products across the globe. The latest twist in a life not without incident or tragedy has stunned the sporting world.
