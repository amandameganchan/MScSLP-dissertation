# ORIG CONTENT  The leader of North Korea is an “awesome guy”, according to former NBA basketball star Dennis Rodman. The athlete, known for his tattoos, body piercings and flamboyance, was in the reclusive Communist state filming a documentary and met Kim Jong-un to take in a basketball game and dinner. Rodman described the dictator’s father and grandfather – Kim Jong-il and Kim Il-sung as “great leaders”. Both ruled the country with an iron fist. Kim said he hoped sports exchanges would promote “mutual understanding between peoples of the two countries”, according to the Chinese government news agency Xinhua. The 30-year-old leader has maintained his father’s drive to secure nuclear arms for his impoverished country, with North Korea last month conducting its third nuclear test, drawing the condemnation of world powers and the United Nations.
