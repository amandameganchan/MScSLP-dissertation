# ORIG CONTENT  Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi has arrived in Germany for meetings with Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin. The trip is an opportunity for Mursi to show his diplomatic credentials, and prove to Europe he has a plan for restoring order in Egypt. He leaves behind a country in crisis. Political and social unrest have led to a week of street violence, in which more than 50 people have died. Egypt’s army chief warned on Tuesday that the country is on the brink of collapse. Mursi has cancelled the Paris part of his European trip.
