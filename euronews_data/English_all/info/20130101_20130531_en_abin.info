# ORIG TITLE    Spain’s PM Rajoy denies receiving secret cash . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Spain’s ruling People’s Party has denied that Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and other leaders received secret cash payments.   The statements come after newspaper El Pais published excerpts from what it said were secret party accounts.   The People’s Party Secretary-General Maria Dolores de Cospedal came out in swift defence of the top man:    “This party categorically denies the content of those alleged documents that have been published. We categorically deny it in all its terms. I have spoken to the Prime Minister this morning as is logical, and I have to say that he is very tranquil,” Cospedal said.    The man at the eye of the storm may be “tranquil”, but opposition leader Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba says Rajoy’s party response is far from satisfactory:    “I want to answers from the Prime Minister directly because this affects him directly. I want him to come out and to answer just two simple questions. Did he receive those funds, yes or no? And if he did, how did he earn them, was it laundered money?,” said Rubalcaba.   On Cospedal’s statement, Rubalcaba asked, “What kind of credibility does this woman have? She was trying to stop the investigation for three years.”    A recent poll, conducted by El Pais, suggested that 96 per cent of Spaniards believe that the level political corruption is “very high”.
