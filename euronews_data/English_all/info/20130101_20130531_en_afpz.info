# ORIG CONTENT  Violence is escalating in Pakistan in the run-up to general elections on May 11. Ali Haider Gilani, the son of former prime minister Yousouf Raza Gilani, was shot at and abducted while campaigning in the central district of Multan. His brother Musa told local media that if Haider was not released by the evening of May 9, he would stop the local vote going ahead. Haider’s secretary and guard were reportedly shot dead in the attack. The Taliban militant group denied involvement in Haider’s capture – but has threatened to disrupt the election with bombings. In the country’s troubled north, candidates for Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI) were targeted by suicide bombers this week.
