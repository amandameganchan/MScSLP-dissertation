# ORIG CONTENT  Claude Nobs, the founder of the Montreaux jazz festival, has died at the age of 76. He had spent several weeks in a coma following a skiing accident. A music lover and harmonica player himself, Nobs launched the eminent music event in 1967 while working at the Montreaux tourism office. Since then the festival has attracted a galaxy of musical stars to the Swiss resort. Nobs was referred to as “Funky Claude” in a Deep Purple song about a fire at a Montreaux casino. Musical legends Miles Davis, Ray Charles and Ella Fitzgerald are among those to have performed on the celebrated festival stages. The event continues to draw huge crowds and last year was headlined by Bob Dylan. Switzerland’s Culture Minister Alain Berset paid warm tribute: . “A great personality of music has passed away, a passionate man. And I think his passion for music made this little miracle on the Leman Lake possible.” .
