# ORIG TITLE    Ireland not to blame for Apple tax – Deputy P.M. 
# ORIG CONTENT  A senior Irish politician is denying the country is to blame for computer giant Apple’s low tax payments. The company paid just 1.9 per cent tax on its non American profits of 28 billion Euros. Apple employs around 3000 people at its subsidiary in Cork. The Irish Deputy Prime Minister says it’s not his country which is the problem, and says it’s an international issue…” They are issues that arise from the taxation system in other jurisdictions and that is an issue that has to be addressed in those jurisdictions”. Nonetheless the American Senate says Dublin is at the centre of a strategy which enabled Apple to save 44 billion dollars in US tax. However, in a statement, Apple said it does not use what it calls tax gimmics, and claims the existence of an Irish subsidiary does not reduce its American tax liability.
