# ORIG TITLE    Latest Syrian death toll ‘truly shocking’ says UN . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The United Nations Human Rights Commissioner Navi Pillay has described as “truly shocking” the latest death toll from the Syrian conflict. According to a study commissioned by the world body, more than 60,000 people have died since the uprising and civil war began in March 2011. The latest amateur footage filmed over the past three days is said to show Syrian government fighter jets bombing several areas, including a suburb of the capital Damascus. It has been verified by an international news agency. Separate unverified video purportedly shows two men being tortured and executed. Activists claim those responsible were Shabbiha fighters, a brutal militia thought to be working with the Syrian regime. The pair were stabbed to death and then stoned with concrete blocks. It is not clear where or when the footage was filmed. The UN compared reports from seven different sources including the Syrian government to come up with the new total, which they estimate has crossed the 60,000 mark since the end of November. Officials say in each case, the victim’s first and last name, the date and location of their death were known.
