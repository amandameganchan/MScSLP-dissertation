# ORIG TITLE    Kenyan election result disputed . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Uhuru Kenyatta has been announced as the winner of the presidential election in Kenya by a slim margin. Results show that he had over 50% of the vote, which is just over the amount needed to avoid a run-off race that has divided the nation along tribal lines. Prime Minister of Kenya Raila Odinga who has lead a coalition government since 2008 has said he will mount a legal challenge against the results. Kenyatta’s victory will pose a dilemma for the country’s big Western donors with his trial for crimes against humanity due to begin at the International Criminal Court in The Hague for orchestrating tribal violence five years ago.
