# ORIG CONTENT  Police investigating the Boston bomb attacks last month say they have arrested three more people. Unconfirmed reports say those being held are not suspected of involvement in the bombings but with helping one of the alleged perpetrators. Two are said to have come to the US from Kazakhstan and to have been college classmates of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, who has been formally charged and is being held in a prison medical centre. One report says the pair have been held in jail for a week over suspected visa irregularities. The third person arrested is reportedly a US citizen. Boston police made the announcement over the arrests in its official Twitter feed. Dzhokhar Tsarnaevâ€™s elder brother Tamerlan died in a gunfight with police.
