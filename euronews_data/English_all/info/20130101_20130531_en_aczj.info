# ORIG CONTENT  EU foreign ministers met in Brussels on Monday to discuss ways to end the conflict in Syria. UN-Arab League envoy Lakhdar Brahimi, who also attended the meeting, is trying to broker an end to the country’s civil war that has left as many as 70,000 people dead. EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said that a means of halting the bloodshed must be found soon. “We need to stop this killing, we need to stop the violence that’s happening in Syria and to find a way in which the opposition can really move forward on a political solution,” she told reporters. “We have been very clear that Assad cannot stay.” . Other officials said dialogue would be the only way out of the crisis. Many EU nations fear arming the rebels would be counter-productive as the weapons could fall into the wrong hands. Belgian Foreign Minister Didier Reynders said: “We will continue to look at how we can help the opposition and I hope Lakhdar Brahimi can start organising talks between one part of the opposition and certain members of the regime, but without President Assad.” . But rebel forces argue that the European Union must do more to end the conflict. They say they need more weapons and more ammunition and are calling for the bloc’s arms embargo to be lifted. At the end of last month, the 27 countries amended sanctions on Syria to permit the supply of armoured vehicles, non-lethal military equipment and technical aid the Syrian opposition, provided they were intended to protect civilians.
