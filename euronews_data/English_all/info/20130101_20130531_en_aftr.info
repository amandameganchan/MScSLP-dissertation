# ORIG TITLE    PSG end 19-year wait for league title . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Paris Saint Germain’s massive two-year spending spree has paid dividends after the French capital club were crowned league one champions for the first time in 19 years and third overall on Sunday. The wealthy Qatari-backed club’s 1-0 win over Lyon handed them an unasailable 7-point lead over Marseilles with two games remaining this season. PSG’s victory also secured arch-rivals Marseille’s automatic qualification for next season’s Champions League group stage by leaving them with a seven-point lead over third-placed Lyon. The Paris club were last crowned champions in 1994. They won their first title in 1986.
