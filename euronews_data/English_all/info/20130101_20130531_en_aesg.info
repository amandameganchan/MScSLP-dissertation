# ORIG TITLE    Assad says West will pay for supporting Al Qaeda in Syria . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Syrian television viewers have watched their President give a rare interview accusing the West of supporting al Qaeda militants in the country’s civil war. Talking on a pro- government TV channel, President Bashar al Assad warned the militants would turn against their backers and strike in the heart of Europe and the US. Throughout the interview the president maintained a righteous tone: . “We have no choice but to be victorious, otherwise Syria will vanish…” . Assad reserves some of his strongest criticism for Jordan and accused it of allowing thousands of fighters to cross into Syria and join the conflict. He also warned the violence could easily spread across to Syria’s neighbour. Recognising what it called the ‘deteriorating situation’ Washington is to send 200 troops to Jordan to help the kingdom boost its defences.
