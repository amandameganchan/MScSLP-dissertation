# ORIG CONTENT  North Korea continues to cause unease following reports from South Korea that two intermediate range missiles on mobile launchers have been placed and hidden on the east coast of the country. Speculation has centered on the types of missiles deployed. One is believed to be the untested Musudan missile with a range of 3,000km, while the other is an intercontinental missile that may be capable of reaching outlying US states such as Alaska or Hawaii. North Korea has been involved in a war of words with South Korea and the United States following sanctions imposed on the country for a nuclear test carried out in February. It has threatened to stage a nuclear strike on the United States, attack bases on the island of Guam and said that the Korean Peninsula is in a state of war.
