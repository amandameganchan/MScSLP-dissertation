# ORIG TITLE    Nine dead as UN convoy ambushed in South Sudan . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Five peacekeepers and seven civilians working for the UN mission in South Sudan have been killed in an ambush. A group of unidentified attackers surprised a convoy as it was traveling through the restive Jonglei state in the east of the country. The Indian foreign ministry has confirmed that the peacekeepers killed were Indian. The nationalities of the dead civilians have yet to be revealed, though two are believed to be South Sudanese. Jonglei has been hit by widespread ethnic violence and cattle rustling since the country became independent from Sudan in 2011. At least nine others have been injured and some remain unaccounted for. South Sudan’s military spokesperson blamed the violence on militants led by David Yau Yau. Last month 150 people were killed in a battle between the South Sudanese army and Yau Yau’s fighters in Jonglei.
