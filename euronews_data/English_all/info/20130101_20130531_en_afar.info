# ORIG CONTENT  Protests have erupted in Bangladesh in the wake of the building collapse that has so far claimed the lives of close to 300 people. Resentment over working conditions for the country’s 3.6 million – mainly female – clothing workers has mounted steadily since the disaster. Thousands took to the streets on Friday to voice their anger at poor building safety standards. Ramesh Roy, General Secretary, from the IndustriALL Bangladesh Council, the global union representing industrial workers told reporters: “The government, the building owner, the buyers, BGMEA (Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association ) and the owner of the factories have to pay compensation equally.” . Rescue efforts in Dhaka continue in earnest and 62 people trapped beneath the rubble were rescued overnight following the collapse on Wednesday. Officials said they hope to reach many more still buried. But this is the country’s third major industrial accident in five months and at some point the wider issue of health and safety will have to be addressed.
