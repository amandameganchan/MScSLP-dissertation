# ORIG TITLE    Syrian rebels call for urgent medical and military aid for Qusair . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Syrian rebels, in the embattled town of Qusair, have appealed for urgent military and medical assistance. They claim they are unable to evacuate 700 wounded people as they are under persistent attack from Syrian government forces backed by Hezbollah fighters. Video footage, which cannot be independently verified, purports to show a town under siege, with opposition fighters reporting persistent artillery fire. The nearby town of Ghanto is also under heavy attack.. The Free Syrian Army says it has fewer than 1,500 fighters defending Qusair and that if it fell a “massacre” would occur. The Shi’ite Muslim group Hezbollah is believed to have committed hundreds of battle hardened militia to back the Syrian government’s attempt to take the town.
