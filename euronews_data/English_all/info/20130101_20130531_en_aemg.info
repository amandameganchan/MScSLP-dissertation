# ORIG TITLE    Champions League semi-final draw . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The draw for the semi-finals of the champions league took place at UEFA’s headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland on Friday and Germany v Spain was the flavour of the day. Last season’s finalist Bayern Munich were drawn against Barcelona who are hunting a fourth champions league crown in eight seasons. Bayern, who are looking for a third final appearance in the last four editions, will be at home for the first leg. An advantage according to the club’s chief executive Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. He said: ‘‘In my opinion it`s a little bit of an advantage for us playing in Munich first. Before Juventus (in the quarters) there had been questions whether this might be an advantage or not. But at the end of the day, this has been a good thing, because we could produce a good result in the first game.’‘ . The other German-Spanish showdown sees Borussia Dortmund lock horns with Jose Mourinho’s nine-times champions Real Madrid. It’s the second time in this season’s competition the pair have been drawn together following the group stage where Dortmund had the upper hand with a draw in Spain and victory on home soil. Bayern and Dortmund will host the first legs which take place on April 23rd and 24th with the second legs a week later. The final is on 25 May at Wembley Stadium, London.
