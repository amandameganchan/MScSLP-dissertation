# ORIG CONTENT  Three deadly blasts have rocked Baghdad leaving 17 dead and dozens wounded. A suicide bomber attacked an army base in Taji to the north of the Iraqi capital. A car bomb was detonated in the neighbourhood of Shula and an army checkpoint to the South was also hit. So far no one has claimed responsibility for the deadly bombings. The attacks come in the wake of rising tensions which erupted in Sunni protests last month putting pressure on Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to leave his post.
