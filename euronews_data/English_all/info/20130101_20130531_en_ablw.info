# ORIG TITLE    JAL seeks 787 grounding compensation . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Japan Airlines is to ask for compensation from Boeing for the grounding of the 787 Dreamliner. Currently no 787s are flying as investigators in Japan and the United States look into problems with the plane’s batteries. JAL – which operates seven Dreamliners – said the fact it cannot use the jets will trim more than 5.5 million euros off its earnings through to the end of the current financial year in March. The carrier said robust demand on European, North American and Southeast Asian routes would help offset the impact of the 787’s grounding, and it increased its annual operating profit forecast by almost 13 percent. “Rather than negotiations with Boeing, the important thing now is getting the 787 flying again safely as soon as we can,” said JAL’s president Yoshiharu Ueki. “However, when the situation has settled down we can and are preparing to begin those talks.” . Rival All Nippon Airways recently said it would seek compensation from Boeing. The grounding follows a battery fire on a JAL 787 at Boston airport in the United States and an emergency landing by another plane on a domestic ANA flight after battery problems triggered a smoke alarm. US officials have said they are making progress in their investigation into the battery fire at Boston.
