# ORIG CONTENT  AC Milan striker Mario Balotelli has been banned for three domestic league matches after insulting a referee during a Serie A game against Fiorentina at the weekend. The temperamental frontman, who was recently reprimanded for smoking on a train, was already automatically suspended for one match after picking up his fourth booking of the season. But another two matches were added on following his outburst at one of the assistant referees at the end of Sunday’s 2-2 draw. The 22-year-old, who was a constant headache for his former Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini – will miss Milan’s crucial games against Napoli and Juventus as well as the visit of Catania as they fight for a direct Champions League berth next season. Milan are currently third in the Serie A, four points behind Napoli and 13 adrift of leaders Juventus.
