# ORIG TITLE    Horse meat scandal plant to close . 
# ORIG CONTENT  It is almost certain that 240 workers are to lose their jobs at Spanghero, the French meat processing company at the centre of the recent scandal involving horse meat mislabelled as beef. The employees are angry and feel abandoned. Jérôme Lagarde, with the Forces Ouvrieres union said: “We want someone to find a solution. The workers have done nothing wrong. They get up at four in the morning and earn 1,000 euros a month. They’re not the ones who bought meat that wasn’t what it was supposed to be.” . The bankrupt firm is in administration and has been given until next Wednesday – by the administrator – to find a buyer. The French agriculture ministry has said it will help, but the workers believe they have little hope of saving their jobs.
