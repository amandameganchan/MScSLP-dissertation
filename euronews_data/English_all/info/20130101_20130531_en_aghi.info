# ORIG CONTENT  US lawmakers have accused Apple of avoiding paying billions of dollars in taxes there.

The European Parliament’s economic affairs committee has voted for a draft law, under which large depositors could lose their savings in order to rescue a troubled bank. The US Federal Reserve chairman has told Congress that the economy still needs support. And that support will continue to come from the central bank’s stimulus programmes. We will discuss all that with Jonathan Ferro from Bloomberg in this edition of Business Weekly.
