# ORIG TITLE    Turks sceptical about Ocalan’s call for PKK peace . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Amid springtime celebrations in Istanbul, Turks reacted to the call by rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan for Kurdish PKK fighters to lay down their arms. The Turkish Prime Minsiter Recep Tayyip Erdogan welcomed Ocalan’s statement as a “positive development”. Istanbul resident Metin Ozer agreed, saying: “I think Ocalan’s message is great news for everyone and I want to congratulate all those who worked on the peace process.” . But others were unconvinced. Senhattin Dogan said: “I don’t think he has enough power in jail to convince people outside. So, I doubt they’ll listen to him, lay down their weapons and get out of Turkey.” . Turkey waits to find out whether a new season of peace is on its way and if, after 30 years of conflict, Ocalan’s statement will usher in the “new era” he described.
