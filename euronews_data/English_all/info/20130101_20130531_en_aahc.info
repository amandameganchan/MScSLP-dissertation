# ORIG CONTENT  German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras have held informal talks in Berlin. The two were taking part in a behind-closed-doors economic forum organised by the German newspaper Die Welt and used the opportunity to meet. Samaras said he was “optimistic” for his country’s future. “We are doing the best to put our household back in order especially to guarantee liquidity which is the engine for an economy which is running well. This, together with investment, these are the two most important elements for our country, which is suffering, especially from unemployment, youth unemployment most of all,” he explained adding he wanted to win back the trust of Europe. It’s understood Angela Merkel discussed the economic situation in Germany, where growth has slowed over the past year though she offered no assessment of the reform programme in Greece. Figures released today showed the harsh economic climate has not thawed. Greece had the EU’s second-highest unemployment rate in November, at 20 percent.
