# ORIG TITLE    Christof Innerhofer takes downhill . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Italy’s Christof Innerhofer kept his composure to claim his third win of the alpine skiing World Cup season in the downhill at Garmisch-Partenkirchen on Saturday. The 28 year old, who also won a downhill bronze medal on the same piste in 2011, took advantage of his knowledge of the terrain to secure the win in an impressive time of one minute and 37.83 seconds. Austria’s Georg Streitberger, the 30th runner out of the gate, produced a solid run but eventually had to settle for second place, 0.12 seconds behind while fellow countryman Klaus Kroell, the defending World Cup downhill champion, was 0.16 seconds further back in third. Hannes Reichelt was fourth and world champion Asked Lund Svindal of Norway finished fifth. This win sees Innerhofer move into third place in downhill standings, behind Svindal and Domink Paris of Italy. The racing in Garmisch continues on Sunday with the giant slalom.
