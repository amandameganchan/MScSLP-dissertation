# ORIG TITLE    Thalidomide allegedly sold in Spain after ban . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The morning sickness drug thalidomide, which caused severe birth defects in babies around the world, continued being sold in Spain after being pulled in other countries – according to a group representing victims. The drug, which was used to treat nausea in early pregnancy in the 1950’s and 1960’s, was withdrawn in 1961. It was found to be linked to birth defects which caused children to be born with shortened arms and legs, or no limbs at all. However, the Spanish Association of Thalidomide Victims told reporters in Madrid on Wednesday that it continued being distributed in Spain for up to six months after the ban, up to May 1962. The association has sued the drug manufacturer, Gruenenthal, for 208 million euros. The company insists that it pulled the drug at the same time as in Germany.
