# ORIG CONTENT  Los Angeles Lakers’ star Kobe Bryant has suffered an achilles tendon injury that appears likely to end his season and maybe even his career. The All-star shooting guard suffered a suspected tear in his left achilles tendon in the final minutes of his side’s regular season game with the Golden State Warriors on Friday. It appears to be a frustrating end to a frustrating season for Bryant and the Lakers who are in danger of missing the playoffs for just the second time in the 17 seasons Bryant has been with franchise. The fourth highest scorer in NBA History is expected to undergo surgery before months of rehabilitation. Bryant will almost definitely miss the rest of the season but it could also bring about a premature end to a glittering career for the 34-year-old.
