# ORIG TITLE    US oil rig reaches safe harbour after running aground . 
# ORIG CONTENT  US salvage experts have successfully towed the Shell oil rig which ran aground in stormy weather off Alaska last week. The Kulluk is now in safe harbour in Kiliuda Bay where it will be examined to assess its seaworthiness after it was refloated. More than 630 people took part in the recovery operation, along with a large fleet of vessels and aircraft. The fortunes of the saucer-shaped rig are being closely watched because it was a major part of Shellâ€™s controversial and error-prone 2012 Arctic drilling program. The extent of the damage to the rig has not yet been determined, although salvage teams have found no signs of breaches to its fuel tanks and only one area where seawater leaked onboard.
