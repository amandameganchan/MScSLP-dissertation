# ORIG CONTENT  An estimated 70,000 people have been displaced by severe floods in Mozambique, according to the United Nations. Severe rains have caused dangerously high sea levels along large parts of the southern African coastline over the past few days. The worst hit area is Gaza province where the town of Chokwe has been completely submerged. Water levels in the area have risen further due to floodwater surging down the Limpopo river. Reports say UN aid has yet to reach tens of thousands of people. “We don’t have any help. No food, no tents. We’re sleeping outside. So we’re appealing for food and shelter,” said one man. In total, 36 people have been killed in Mozambique. Several more have died in South Africa. The UN predicts more than 100,000 people could be made temporarily homeless if water levels continue to rise.
