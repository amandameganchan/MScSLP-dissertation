# ORIG TITLE    Deteriorating conditions inside factory shared by North and South Korea . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Tension is evident at the last shared economic link between North and South Korea. It is factory at the Kaesong Industrial park in the North where only factory managers and worker from the South have been allowed to leave – entry into the facility has been barred by Pyongyang with the factory closed off since April 3. South Korean workr Han Nam-Il described conditions inside the facility. “The factory cafeteria is not providing with meals because there’s no food left. We’ve been sharing our own personal food. We can probably hold up for two to three days, but no more than that,” he said. With the Korean peninsula in crisis and Pyongyang threatening a nuclear strike against the US, North Korean authorities have told foreign embassies they would be unable to guarantee their safety if a conflict breaks out. North Korea’s third nuclear test last month triggered new United Nations sanctions against the famine-prone nation of 25 million people, sparking reprisal rhetoric from North Korea leader Kim Jong-Un.
