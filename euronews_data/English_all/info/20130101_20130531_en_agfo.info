# ORIG TITLE    France: dramatic suicide reignites same-sex marriage furore . 
# ORIG CONTENT  The suicide of far-right French historian Dominique Venner has brought the spotlight back onto the divisive issue of same-sex marriage, recently legalised in France. Venner, 78, took his life inside Notre-Dame cathedral on May 21, reportedly by shooting himself in front of the altar. Earlier the same day, the award-winning essayist published a blog post savaging the legalisation of homosexual marriage. Venner wrote: “I think I need to sacrifice myself to break the lethargy that overwhelms us” adding “spectacular and symbolic actions” were needed to wake up the French people. Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Front party hailed the suicide as a “political act”. The French Interior Minister Manuel Valls said: “Notre Dame is the cathedral of Paris, one of the capital’s and the country’s most beautiful monuments, so we realise how symbolic this event truly is.” . Valls said there were 1,500 people inside the cathedral, adding: “I can only imagine how shocking it was for those faithful, those tourists.” . The cathedral is visited by some 13 million people from around the world every year. On the evening of the suicide, gay-rights supporters had gathered in Paris’ Place de la Bastille for a live music event to celebrate the legalisation of same-sex marriages in France. Tuesday’s death comes less than a week after another unusual suicide in central Paris, when a man shot himself in front of a dozen schoolchildren at a private Catholic school in the French capital. The cathedral’s rector said a few people had committed suicide by jumping from Notre Dame’s twin towers, but he had no knowledge of anyone ever committing suicide on the altar.
