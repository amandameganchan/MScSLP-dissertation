# ORIG CONTENT  The financial markets are keeping a close eye on Italy’s elections and what they fear most is an inconclusive result. Analysts say that could prompt an even bigger sell-off of shares than would the return to power of scandal-mired Silvio Berlusconi, who led the country to the financial brink in 2011. Italian stocks, government bonds and even the euro are expected to benefit if, as the latest polls suggest, the centre-left prevails, leading to the creation of a reform-minded government. As Berlusconi made gains in opinion polls in recent weeks there was a big sell off by investors of Italian shares and bonds. A hung parliament would see Rome forced to increase the amount of interest it has to offer to get investors to buy its bonds. That would have a knock-on effect in the rest of the eurozone periphery, especially in Spain. Italy’s borrowing costs have fallen sharply since Mario Monti formed his technocrat administration in November 2011 launching austerity policies that saved the country from a Greek-style debt crisis . Whoever wins, they will have a tough time digging Italy out of its deep recession. The economy has been shrinking for the 18 months. Last year it contracted by 2.2 percent, and many companies are saying it is now time to pull down the barriers that have hampered Italian businesses and put foreign investors off Italy for years.
