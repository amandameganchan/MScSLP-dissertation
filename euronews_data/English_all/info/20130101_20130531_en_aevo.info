# ORIG TITLE    Tough talks as Turkey and Israel meet over fatal flotilla attack . 
# ORIG CONTENT  An Israeli delegation has arrived in Turkey for talks on normalising relations between the two countries, following the Israeli raid on a Gaza-bound aid flotilla in 2010. The attack on the Mavi Marmara by Israeli commandos killed nine pro-Palestinian Turks as the vessel tried to breach Israelâ€™s blockade of Gaza. Ankara cut its once extensive ties with Israel, expelled its ambassador and froze military cooperation. After a UN report into events in 2011 failed to condemn Israel, Turkey set precise conditions on a return to normal relations. An apology, compensation for the victims and an end to the Israeli blockade of Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu apologised last month. However, Israel is unlikely to lift its blockade of Gaza, but compensation could be agreed. In return Israel wants charges against its soldiers in Turkish courts dropped. The families of the victims say they will not drop charges or accept compensation until Israel eases restrictions on Gaza.
