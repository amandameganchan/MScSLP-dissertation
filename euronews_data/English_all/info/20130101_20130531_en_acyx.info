# ORIG TITLE    Confirmation urgently sought over Nigeria hostage deaths claim . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Concern is growing for the fate of seven foreign hostages after a Nigerian Islamist group posted a statement on a website saying they had been killed. The seven – from Britain, Greece, Italy and Lebanon – were seized last month from a construction site in the northern state of Bauchi. The group known as Ansaru said it had carried out the kidnapping in revenge for what it called ‘atrocities by European nationals against Islam’. It claimed the hostages had been killed because of a failed rescue attempt by British and Nigerian forces. Officials say they are not aware of any such attempt.
