# ORIG TITLE    US and Turkey agree on a Syria without Assad . 
# ORIG CONTENT  US President Barack Obama and Turkey’s Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan have both declared there is no place for Syria’s president in any future democracy in the war torn country. Speaking after lengthy talks in Washington between the two leaders, although they managed to cover every thing from terrorism to trade, it was the Syrian conflict which dominated. Although it is known Erdogan will have been pushing for more determination on the part of the US to help end the conflict – such as arming the rebels – Obama remained fixed to his previous position of only offering humanitarian aid. Although further talks are scheduled for his one-day trip, Erdogan may be returning home without winning over more US support.
