# ORIG CONTENT  Venezuela’s new President Nicolas Maduro has named his new cabinet but there are many familiar faces from the past. The Vice President Jorge Arreaza, Foreign Minister Elias Jaua and Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez all keep their current roles. Maduro was sworn in two days ago accompanied by a full military parade which coincided with the country’s celebration of its declaration of independence. But nightly protests are still continuing with the main opposition candidate Henrique Capriles claiming the closely contested election was rigged.
