# ORIG CONTENT  We are used now to seeing thousands of people demonstrating in Egypt’s Tahrir Square. But what we do not see, and what is increasingly taking place, are brutal attacks against women. There have been a string of rapes and sexual assaults and several “bodyguard” groups have been set up to protect female demonstrators. Now some protesters say they are ready to take drastic measures to ensure the attacks stop. “If the Muslim Brotherhood do not leave power we, the women of Egypt promise that we will go out in the streets naked, we do not care about any one and we will remain on the street until the departure of Mursi.” . Meanwhile, there has been a spike in the number of women signing up for self-defence classes. The aim is to boost women’s confidence and deter what organisers say is daily harassment.
