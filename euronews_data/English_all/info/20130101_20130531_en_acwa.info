# ORIG CONTENT  A major snowstorm is continuing to cause serious problems across much of the US eastern coast. More than 150,000 homes and business in nine states are without power. Virginia has mobilised the National Guard and called a state of emergency after experiencing wet, heavy snow and rain fall. At least four people have died in road traffic accidents. Road, rail and air travel have been severely disrupted. Nearly 2,500 flights were cancelled yesterday in Washington, Philadelphia and New York.. The National Weather Service has called off winter warnings, however, for Washington, after warm Atantic air lessened the storm’s impact in the capital area. The storm had been dubbed “snowquestration” by Washington wags in a nod to the battle over the federal budget blocus. It had been predicted to be the biggest in the capital area for two years.
