# ORIG CONTENT  Bayern Munich will be looking to hold on to their four goal advantage over Barcelona when both sides meet again for the second leg of their Champions League semi final clash at the Camp Nou on Wednesday. Barcelona defender Adriano is available after completing a one-match ban while Lionel Messi, who has scored 54 goals this season, should start after being troubled by a hamstring injury in recent weeks. Bayern Munich boss Jupp Heynckes, who’ll have to make do without the services of the injured Toni Kroos, has confirmed he will not be resting players who are at risk of missing the final should they get booked. Mario Gomez, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Javi Martinez, Dante and Philipp Lahm are all just one caution away from missing the next game. The last time Bayern played at the Camp Nou in 2009, Barcelona won 4-0, a result they’ll need to at least match on Wednesday to have any chance of reaching the final.
