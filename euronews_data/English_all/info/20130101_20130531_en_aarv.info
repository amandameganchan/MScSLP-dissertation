# ORIG CONTENT  British Prime Minister David Cameron has again had to postpone a major speech on Europe, his timetable being derailed by events in Algeria. The speech had been flagged as outlining what powers London wanted to claw back from Brussels. Instead Cameron has a crisis to manage. “It is a very dangerous, a very uncertain, a very fluid situation and I think we have to prepare ourselves for the possibility of bad news ahead. Cobra officials here are working around the clock to do everything we can to keep in contact with the families to build a full as possible picture of the information and the inteligence that we have,” he said in London. Cameron had been due to give his much-awaited speech in Amsterdam after initially promoting it last autumn, but has had to repeatedly delay it to avoid clashing with other political events.
