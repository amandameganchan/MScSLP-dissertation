# ORIG TITLE    Uruguay President caught insulting Argentina’s Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner . 
# ORIG CONTENT  Uruguay’s President Jose Alberto Mujica has made no apologies for his offensive remarks picked up by an open microphone against his Argentinian counterpart Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner. He was heard saying that “in order to get something from Argentina you have to get into bed a bit with Brazil. This old hag (referring to Cristina Fernandez) is worse than her one-eyed husband (referring to Nestor Kirchner who had a lazy eye). He had more political sense, she is as stubborn as a mule,” he added. “She doesn’t know what she is doing.” Mujica also mocked the President’s gift of a flask for tea to Pope Francis. Jose Mujica has since said that Uruguay and Argentina have close ties and no event or person could “uproot their common history.” .
