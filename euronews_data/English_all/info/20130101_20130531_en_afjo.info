# ORIG TITLE    One dead, 17 injured in Belgian train crash . 
# ORIG CONTENT  A goods train carrying a variety of chemicals and toxic raw materials en route to the Netherlands from Germany has derailed and caught fire near the Belgian village of Schellebelle. One person died and 17 were injured. Three of the trainâ€™s 12 wagons caught fire after half of them derailed due to a points failure. Residents within 500 metres of the blaze have been evacuated, while anyone within 1000 metres has been warned to stay indoors with their windows shut. The authorities say 300 people have been evacuated, but there is no danger to public health despite at least one of the wagons containing cyanide. Firefighters are allowing the blaze to burn itself out as tackling it with water would allow the dispersal of toxic materials into the air and soil.
