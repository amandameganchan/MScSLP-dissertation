# ORIG TITLE    Work on new sarcophagus continues as Chernobyl marks 27 years . 
# ORIG CONTENT  With the 27th anniversary of the nuclear disaster in Chernobyl, it is a time to reflect, but also a time to look to the future. Construction on a new shelter for the town’s infamous power station is on track and is due to be finished by October 2015. The new sarcophagus will safely contain the radioactive emissions of Chernobyl for the next 100 years. Chernobyl’s Ivankiv hospital is receiving 1.4 million euros from the EU for equipment to measure radioactivity. For the first time residents in the Ukrainian town will have a place to go where they can check levels in their food. The equipment will also be used to check contamination levels in the local population. “It’s an open secret that this area is still contaminated, and though the level of some radioactive elements like Cesium-137 in some products is lower than 10 years ago, they are still very dangerous,” said Yuriy Bandazhevskiy from the Science and Technology centre in Ukraine. The 1986 accident released a lethal radioactive cloud, which contaminated swathes of Ukraine, Belarus and further afield. There is controversy over the death toll, however some claim up to five million people have been affected. The area around the plant is still very contaminated and is designated as a depopulated “exclusion zone”.
