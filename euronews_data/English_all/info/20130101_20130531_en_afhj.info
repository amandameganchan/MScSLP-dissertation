# ORIG CONTENT  Textile production has resumed in Bangladesh after an eight-day shutdown following the collapse of a building housing a clothes factory. Thousands of workers have gone back to work after the tragedy in a Dhaka suburb prompted a mass strike. Emergency workers have continued pulling bodies from the debris. At the last count at least 429 people were known to have died in the country’s worst industrial accident. Some have been buried unidentified and people are still looking for missing relatives. The EU has warned Bangladesh, which has duty-free access to its markets, to improve safety standards or face trade sanctions. Sixty percent of clothes made in the country are sold to Europe. Exports are worth over 14 billion euros a year. But the accident has highlighted poor conditions and low pay. Most workers are paid barely 30 euros a month. Britain’s Primark and Canadian retailer Loblaw, whose Joe Fresh clothing was made at the collapsed building, have promised to compensate victims’ families.
