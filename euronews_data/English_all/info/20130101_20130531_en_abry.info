# ORIG CONTENT  A Polish film about a gay priest’s love for a disadvantaged youth has had its world premier at the Berlinale Film Festival. ‘In the Name of’ by director Malgoska Szumowska is in competition for the prestigious Golden Bear award. The movie deals with the priest’s inner torment as his infatuation with the young man leads to spiritual despair. “I made this film, among other things, in order to defend otherness and the right to love. A priest also has a right to love as well,” said the director. The release comes just weeks after the Polish parliament rejected draft laws, which would have handed limited rights to gay couples.
