# ORIG CONTENT  A senior opposition figure in Egypt has called for urgent talks with the government, amid the wave of violence in the country. Mohamed ElBaradei of the National Salvation Front wants an immediate meeting involving President Mursi, leading ministers, the governing party and the Salafist movement – to begin what he calls serious dialogue. Wednesday morning saw more clashes in Cairo near Tahrir Square. Protesters threw stones at police who responded by firing tear gas. The scuffles did not last long, but both sides of the political divide agree the trouble must end. Protesters have continued to defy the authorities in cities along the Suez Canal, where the president announced a month-long state of emergency last weekend. In Suez and Ismailia a curfew was again largely ignored. Shops and stalls remained open after nightfall. Some people made it clear what they thought of Mursi’s attempt to impose his authority, by dancing and playing football in the streets. For many, the restrictions and extended police powers of arrest and detention evoke the same hated measures taken by the ex-dictator Hosni Mubarak. People accuse the new leader and his Muslim Brotherhood of trying to monopolise power. The authorities have blamed the unrest on thugs and supporters of Mubarak’s regime.
