# ORIG TITLE    Mixed Madrid feelings for Mourinho . 
# ORIG CONTENT  What Jose Mourinho wants Jose Mourinho usually gets, but be careful what you wish for. The Spanish press has heaped it on the Portugueses’ head even before he was on the trail back to Chelsea; accusing him of going to war with Real Madrid from the inside to get out of his contract. His much-trumpeted love of English football and Chelsea has swayed him as much as money, but relations with Roman Abrahmovich will be crucial, and it is very much the Russian’s club, a situation the special one is rarely comfortable with. “He should’ve left a year ago, he should be ashamed and have a little respect for others, I’m a bit shocked. And well, he hasn’t achieved his objectives in Madrid so he’s pointless. These guys get paid so much, they should get paid according to objectives. If you achieve the objective you get the 50 million, and if not then out you go. In Spain there are lots of people who live on less than 1000 euros,” was one fan’s reaction. “It’s terrible, I think he has done well until now. He’s had arguments with the heavyweights. I think he is good coach, let’s see who comes next,” was a more supportive position. So Mourniho has slipped the chains of a 20-million-euro buyout clause and is a free agent, leaving behind a Real he took back to the top in Spain, but with whom he failed in Europe, this proud club’s ulltimate prize. In the parallel financial universe in which Real’s president Florentino Perez operates the end of the Mourinho relationship must mean something, but Perez is not telling.
