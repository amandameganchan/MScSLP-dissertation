20130101_20130531_en_aadj-0028 how can the situation in Venezuela evolve and which path of development will the country now take to see this more clearly we're joined from Moscow by Professor Boris Martynov assistant Director of the Latin American Institute within the Russian Academy of
20130101_20130531_en_aadj-0029 January ten scheduled inauguration of Hugo Chavez not many believe he will show up what's next should we expect new elections as the constitution states or the ceremony will be simply postponed
20130101_20130531_en_aadj-0030 I think that the constitutional norms will be followed to the letter anything else will just harm the interests of the authorities
20130101_20130531_en_aadj-0032 it can be either the continuity scenario when Chavez hands over all power to Vice President Maduro calls the next elections in thirty days
20130101_20130531_en_aadj-0034 to the newly elected speaker of National Assembly but who all the same sets the next elections in thirty days according to constitution
20130101_20130531_en_aadj-0036 yes the opposition can more active because for example in spite of all Chavez's victories it's managed to make some serious progress first of all by finding a common candidate
20130101_20130531_en_aadj-0037 as for the extreme scenarios as I earlier it can only harm Venezuela's position the country is firmly integrated in Latin Anerican structures where democracy is the proclaimed norm

20130101_20130531_en_aadj-0048 diverse this left flank is it's characterised by powerful state structures with strong social component
20130101_20130531_en_aadj-0050 I think that while following in that development mould Venezuela will gradually shred this Chavez Ian radicalism his

20130101_20130531_en_aadn-0002 the first of all Europe is heavily involved financially in resolution of this conflict since it funds half of the annual aid to the Palestinian authority

20130101_20130531_en_aadn-0009 so we often only reach a weak consensus rather strong decisions like the United States where of course power is much more centralised in the hands of one man
20130101_20130531_en_aadn-0011 for example the United States voted against the Palestinian authority obtaining observer status at the UN whereas EU heavyweights such as France Spain and Italy all voted in favour the rest abstained and only one country voted against the Czech Republic

20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0014 well it's forty years since Ireland first joined what was then the European economic community
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0018 contributed to the bringing in of a lot of laws like for example equal pay and equality legislation a lot of our environmental legislation had its origins in Europe so it's been a very positive experience OK let's go to a second question for the deputy prime minister
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0020 I would like to know which plans has to solve the flag crisis northern Ireland and how you expect to manage the rise of nationalism
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0021 Europe so Maria would like to know what you think about nationalism you must be a bit concerned by recent events in Belfast
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0022 yes indeed we are and I think what it shows is the need for constant vigilance to work on our
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0023 we had a conflict in northern Ireland which lasted for about thirty years was a very violent conflict three
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0028 we worked on peace process the Irish and the British government together with the political parties in northern Ireland which brought about a settlement and the establishment of a shared administration in northern Ireland we have however seen in recent weeks
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0029 which are worrying I hope that they not last but I think it shows the challenges that we have to build a shared future for people in northern Ireland I think it also shows the degree to which national identity and other identities are very strong throughout Europe the European Union has been successful
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0032 have very strong national or regional identity and I think important that we first of all respect those identities but that is mutual respect all round
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0038 I think it's important that we all recognise that the European Union is made up not of any one state or indeed a small number of large states the European Union is made up twenty-seven member states and
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0044 of all of the member states working together of there being mutual respect between smaller states large states
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0053 comes from our interdependence big strength that the European Union has is that there are five hundred million people in the European Union is the biggest consumer
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0057 our currency and with financial system I think we have to move beyond those problems now and concentrate on getting economic growth in Europe building on the strengths
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0059 that we are interdependent on each other it's not case one state or a number of
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0062 is the first presidency of the next trio with Ireland Lithuania and Greece and I would to know you are going to do to make sure you have a strong cohesion and a good cooperation between those three countries in difficult economic times
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0065 yes as far as the rotating presidency concerned of course there is also the presidency of the European Council a permanent institution president Van Rompoy and of course President the Commission president Barroso
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0066 and the high representative for Foreign and security I think the new trio arrangement
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0067 the presidency works with the two succeeding presidencies in Ireland's case that will mean we will be working with Lithuania and Greece gives continuity to our work there is a particular agenda that will have to be driven forward in the next six months and Ireland is very conscious of that we

20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0083 a number of initiatives that Ireland intends to take during the European Union presidency among them is bringing forward the
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0084 of youth guarantee in other words that young people will have access to employment to work experience or to education and training the worst situation that young people can be left in in a state of idleness

20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0001 premeditation behind the killing of three Kurdish activists in Paris caused many to ponder on the motives behind the murders
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0002 one thing is certain the deaths and the manner of the killings a single bullet to the head of two of the women a third was hit in the chest and head suggests something more than a botched burglary
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0004 our correspondent in Paris Giovanni is at the scene of the killings as security forces begin their complex and no doubt international investigation into the triple murder
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0005 we saw a crowd of distraught Kurds protesting against the killings you have spoken to them what are their feelings about the deaths
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0007 we in the centre of Paris where a large Kurdish community lives since morning when the news broke hundreds made their way here
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0010 the fact that this violence was carried out against women three women activists it emphasises the shock and level of violence involved
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0011 for the hundreds here there been moments of reflection an unreal silence
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0016 there already a number of being put forward the murders with ramifications beyond French borders where will French investigators begin the probe
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0018 firstly we have to be careful as the investigation has started
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0021 so the police will be looking into those who want to derail any peace process
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0031 we already know one of the victims is a close associate of the imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan what do know her
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0041 the death of such a high profile victim suggests a political motive behind
20130101_20130531_en_aajq-0001 Kurdish activists have suggested the Turkish state was responsible for the women's murders a senior member of the ruling party in Turkey has blamed internal feuding within the PKK
20130101_20130531_en_aajq-0005 if the fundamental is see the collapse of this complicated difficult process which will be very long if this is the objective of those behind the murders we can only hope that they will not succeed obviously this Kurdish issue' in Turkey is the main challenge for Turkey to finally be able to pursue its
20130101_20130531_en_aajq-0009 as far as Paris is concerned is true that for a number of years there have been many cases of revolutionary taxes
20130101_20130531_en_aajq-0012 remember the PKK is classed a terrorist organisation not only by France but also by the European Union by the United States and by Turkey which goes saying
20130101_20130531_en_aajq-0013 the anti terrorist arm of the Paris prosecutors' Department has conducted several operations and inquiries which have led some arrests and convictions of people charge of the PKK who were implicated in illegal financial operations
20130101_20130531_en_aajq-0014 so not entirely new for this financial dimension to be present in the PKK's activities in France and in Paris
20130101_20130531_en_aajr-0001 the visit of President Hamid Karzai for talks in Washington with Obama marks the beginning of the end of negotiations between the two countries on the
20130101_20130531_en_aajr-0005 three fundamental talking points are how many American troops will remain in Afghanistan after bulk of the military withdraw immunity from prosecution for US military serving in Afghanistan and peace talks between Kabul and moderate Taliban clans
20130101_20130531_en_aajr-0006 so how many troops will remain in theatre after American mandate ends in fourteen the debate is still raging in the corridors of power the top US commander in the region Marine Corps General John Allen has a force of between six and fifteen
20130101_20130531_en_aajr-0007 according to sources the Defense Department has drawn up a plan which will leave between three

20130101_20130531_en_aajr-0013 those in the know Karzai have some room for manoeuvre on this but it depends on what
20130101_20130531_en_aajr-0015 last but not least some form of Taliban involvement in the political process is key to prevent the country from slipping back into violence as soon as US troops pack
20130101_20130531_en_aajr-0016 informal meetings have already taken place on this issue last month in Chantilly France members of the high Council for peace in Afghanistan the Taliban and others took part in a seminar on the future of Afghanistan
20130101_20130531_en_aajr-0017 both leaders want and need a win win outcome Karzai wants to look less like a US puppet back home and Obama needs a smooth withdrawal to justify his decision to pull out of the country

20130101_20130531_en_aarm-0024 that's what we are doing our profession but at the same time we all a responsibility
20130101_20130531_en_aarn-0001 has had its wings clipped for the first time a decade the French based company has lost its crown as the world's largest maker of passenger jets to rivals Boeing
20130101_20130531_en_aarn-0002 sales of its flagship superjumbo a three eighty the airliner in the world were around one third of the company's target figure after a problem with wings of the aircraft but Airbus is confident of future as airlines look to replace their fleets with more fuel efficient planes
20130101_20130531_en_aarn-0003 in two thousand twelve we had a very good year which was better than expected we remain the market leader both in terms of the backlog of orders with orders for close to four
20130101_20130531_en_aarn-0004 hundred aircraft on our books that's seven years of production and that year after year we continued to increase our deliveries our speed of delivery to our customers
20130101_20130531_en_aarn-0005 despite buoyant tone sales were than the company's record year in two thousand eleven net orders that is after cancellations totalled eight hundred thirty-three a drop of forty-one percent
20130101_20130531_en_aaro-0004 are not expected to take part in combat operations although France's top diplomat hinted that may change

20130101_20130531_en_aarp-0014 I think if you were removed from outside that single market and have no influence on the conditions that apply there
20130101_20130531_en_aarp-0019 and in theory if you were to say OK you can revise membership for one country' then you might have a lot of
20130101_20130531_en_aarq-0004 what I like most without asking myself is this wearable or fit for the street and this the result this is what I was feeling
20130101_20130531_en_aarq-0005 won the designer for tomorrow in Berlin last year his latest work is inspired by angels
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0007 no it's a good thing and when it comes to flight safety the whole industry supports that so I hope above all that Boeing can fly the seven
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0010 you understand that the aviation industry is organised in a way that we agencies that verify the safety of our aircraft
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0013 despite your good results for twelve Boeing was well ahead of Airbus in terms of orders and
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0015 rival knocked you off the number one spot after several years what lessons can Airbus learn from that
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0016 the lesson is that in twelve we had a very good year which was better than expected with deliveries up ten percent
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0018 so you say we fell a long way behind Boeing we remain the market leader both in terms of the backlog of orders
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0020 seven aircraft on our books that's seven of production and that year after year we continued to increase our deliveries our speed of
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0026 if you look at Asia they are our fastest growing areas so we're not dependent on growth in one area such as Europe or the United States
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0027 indeed we are dependent on global growth and that growth is happening so I think we can on the figures I've announced and we won't see any surprises in
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0028 after you first came up the concept of the a three eighty you have only two hundred fifty-seven firm orders when do you expect to finally get over the problem of cracks appearing in the a three wings and for sales really off
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0029 firstly the problem of the micro found on aircraft in service in early twelve has been fixed
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0030 we found the cause we have come up with solutions and so hundred planes currently in service with airlines are being gradually retrofitted through to the end of fourteen
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0034 but eventually with the a three eighty we will take the lead because of congestion in the skies and with airports limited to the size they are they're going to need big planes like the a three
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0038 and whether we're ahead of Boeing or behind them the market is growing five percent year so who's ahead really isn't that important
20130101_20130531_en_aars-0001 Airbus has lost its top spot to its US arch rival Boeing even though the European planemaker delivered record numbers of airliners last year but despite no longer being the number one is confident of improvements in both orders and this year as airlines look to replace their fleets with fuel efficient planes it delivered five hundred eighty-eight aircraft last year orders were a different story Airbus was able to
20130101_20130531_en_aars-0002 record net orders that is after cancellations totalled eight hundred thirty-three down forty-one percent far short of Boeing's
20130101_20130531_en_aars-0006 because of a potential fire risk from batteries it is not yet clear how much of a set back that will be for Boeing but analyst it could cost the
20130101_20130531_en_aars-0009 if they find something that needs to be recertified they will do that post production that's costly
20130101_20130531_en_aars-0012 a it remains confident the a three will achieve its maiden flight by the Middle of year

20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0001 the global economic outlook may be slightly improved but it's still a major headache for politicians and policymakers alike not least those on the front line like the International Monetary Fund so to discuss the perilous path ahead I am joined by the managing Director of the
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0004 there are two certainties in life death and taxes now I'd like to add another one and that's climate of uncertainty
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0005 is two thousand thirteen going to prove as uncertain as two thousand twelve
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0009 that policymakers will address the uncertainties and will try to remove them as much as they can in two thousand thirteen so that confidence can be restored
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0013 there's been a certain amount of back slapping here over Europe people congratulating themselves that Europe is back on the path to recovery it strikes me now the battle lines have been redrawn and
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0016 we've avoided the collapse in two thousand twelve we should guard against the relapse in two thousand thirteen and now is certainly not the time relax
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0020 the policymakers have to keep the momentum continue the reform continue sensible tax consolidations continue and complete the financial regulation
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0024 some may say put Europe in peril Britain in peril and for me it's symptomatic of European leaders putting their domestic agendas
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0029 the obstacles have arguments debates and eventually come out of it all together and stronger I really hope that's what happens in or out
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0031 and when it is striving and more competitive I think that's a debate that will be initiated as result of that
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0033 the Chancellor from Germany has indicated her determination to discuss competitiveness and as we know competitiveness is at the heart of many
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0035 to another issue accountability is very important you and the IMF was admirable in that it did admit mistakes in terms of its austerity measures to put it crudely
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0036 but mistakes have affected the lives millions of people in Greece for example should the IMF be held accountable
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0038 accountable just like anybody engaged in a public mission or in the private sector are all accountable and I think that the first measure of accountability to come up with the truth is to hide things behind the curtains or under the carpet
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0039 been a difficult decision but we have decided that we should be totally open to our membership and say you know as we constantly
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0040 we reassess we verify we check numbers our assumptions against the new reality now I submit that the new reality of
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0043 as we call them technically have indeed changed over time we want to recognise that to admit it
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0051 Greece had to consolidate Greece had to restructure Greece had to adjust its
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0053 the fiscal multiplier was higher than we had initially anticipated when the first programme was designed but it's not just on the basis of a fiscal multiplier that a programme is completed
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0054 the issue of Greece a few months back you caused some outcry when you said that you sympathise more
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0059 do not regret it I was returning from Africa and had in my mind and I still do today
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0060 children of Niger that I had who had teeny tiny little classrooms outside hardly any books and when the person me
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0063 and I added that it would be a good thing if all Greek people were paying their tax I still stand by that and clearly now endorsed by Greek authorities by the Greek
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0065 authorities and so on and so forth and there is a clear recognition that if the Greek authorities actually collect all taxes due including in particular from the wealthy Estates then the economy would be a lot better
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0075 deliver anywhere between seven and eight percent growth in two thousand thirteen it has now a new leadership team which has made it very clear that deliver on twelve th continual
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0078 China is clearly going to be one of the driving forces of global economy going forward so talk of a bubble is unfounded
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0080 they are likely to originate and particularly when it comes to real estate because I believe estate coupled with financial bubbles can be devastating as seen for the last five years but I would say that
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0085 is also overshadowing a greater problem the massive unemployment are we forgetting unemployment in the world when we look
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0089 are certainly significantly better and heading towards seven percent so that's an improvement but overall clearly unemployment is a major issue and the numbers that have been released by the
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0095 where everybody should really focus their attention making sure that growth will pick up because
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0099 speaking to the head of the ILO guy Ryder and he was saying what him was now we seem to be on path to recovery talking about the path to recovery but business people are forgetting about unemployment and he is worried that that is not to be tackled
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0103 because growth in and itself is not going to address the overall problem of balanced growth sustainable growth inclusive growth which we all recognise should be the attributes of growth and if you don't have jobs with growth forget about inclusiveness people excluded they don't participate in growth and therefore it's not sustainable so no I think jobs will remain at the centre of people's preoccupations make sure that is the case and
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0105 you see the unrest amongst the young people in world shaping out as we move into
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0106 number one it's double that of the general population and the general average and that's verified the world when you have a ten percent unemployment rate somewhere it's
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0111 and despair for not being able to enter the job market and that touches on the accountability principle that very keen about which I think will be
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0113 society is accountable to those young accountable to make sure that they are educated that they get the education that will give them access to the job market and that that growth is actually fueled
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0116 there's a lot of talk here at the for about global risks touched on quite a few here what other global risks do you identify
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0118 zones such as the United States if the big issues of the medium term debt reduction and deficits are not addressed properly you've got Japan if again the medium term debt
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0119 issue not addressed properly with identifiable solid anchorage you have the eurozone where construction and reconstruction and
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0125 clear effects on the stability of these economic zones you have a lot of territorial issues that often have to do with scarcity of resources
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0126 so all of those are risks that need to be addressed with goodwill and with cooperation I think what we most need going forward is cooperation
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0127 and policymakers wondering not just how they can fix their own domestic issues or how they rally support around national causes but
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0128 what does it have outside and how can we get the best benefit out of

20130101_20130531_en_abrn-0039 exactly I can't speak ill of others on the contrary I want to be positive the other day in Russia
20130101_20130531_en_abrn-0040 me about a Zenit player I liked and I said the captain Denisov because he's really great player with a lot qualities is important for us
20130101_20130531_en_abrn-0041 the problem with Denisov and Kerzhakov was only a problem of money or some other Prejudice against you
20130101_20130531_en_abrn-0042 honestly I don't know I never talked with them about it I don't what they discussed with the clubs administration about me and I never read anything in the press about it for me not important we don't need be friends we need to respect other on pitch everyone has a life of their own
20130101_20130531_en_abrn-0043 during the match against Milan in the Champions League you were replaced before the end you didn't like it and you discussed it with the coach
20130101_20130531_en_abrn-0044 after the match you mentioned you might leave Zenit in January it didn't happen will leave in the summer
20130101_20130531_en_abrn-0047 in the coach and teammates don't think about that I feel more motivated to play for Zenit and will see on the
20130101_20130531_en_abrn-0050 fan Forum published a manifesto its website calling for a team without black or gay players I quote we are not racists but for us the lack of black players at Zenit is just an important tradition
20130101_20130531_en_abrn-0052 we are there play regardless of colour can be black White blue or yellow we are the same all flesh and
20130101_20130531_en_abrn-0054 the differences don't exist and this Prejudice shouldn't exist I must say I don't know
20130101_20130531_en_abrn-0055 only know the fans who back the team for ninety minutes they encourage me and my name so I have a positive view of Zenit fans and I have no problems

20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0033 it's the first time in Tunisia's history that a man has assassinated because of his political stance particularly since fall of the previous regime
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0034 the second consequence is that this assassination is going to deepen the atmosphere of frustration and division while the people have some very big political expectations
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0036 and those close to Belaid have accused the main party Ennahda in the ruling coalition of being behind this assassination
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0038 we say that the Tunisian government's great powerlessness lies in the perturbed and equivocal relationship at the heart of the movement between the leadership and representatives of a more radical and Salafist movement
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0041 this ambiguous relationship as well as the government's helplessness facilitated such an assassination
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0042 is what is happening today in Egypt and Tunisia the result of a failure of Islamist parties in power
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0043 the situation in Tunisia resembles enormously that in Egypt we observe this failure of governments and of political parties emanating from elections at the same time the other political parties not acted in a convincing enough manner to be able to succeed at the next elections
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0048 the events and particular circumstances are different but after October eighty-eight and the arrival of the Islamic Salvation front and other extremist groups assassinations of public figures multiplied just because they had said no to keeping people in the dark in that sense there is a resemblance Tunisia and Egypt
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0049 but what is positive is that these two countries can learn lessons from what happened in Algeria in so as the Algerian government at the time closed its eyes to the abuses against civilians political parties and intellectuals
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0001 productivity is Italy's biggest problem and will be the next government's biggest challenge industrial production is down and labour productivity is not competitive which means manufacturing jobs are disappearing
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0002 so car giant has decided to go global on the one hand by merging with American auto maker Chrysler on the other by investing in innovation especially in its plants abroad
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0003 the company has recently invested one billion euros in factory to buy machinery needed to produce two new car models
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0004 says has no intention of closing down factories in Italy but at time the company recently announced a redundancy Fund over years the measures effectively mean less and drastic pay cuts the plant's five five hundred
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0005 while there is growing concern among the trade unions that many people could lose their jobs due to outsourcing these workers are trying to stay positive
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0006 their hopes investment of this kind help his keep up in a competitive and innovative environment
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0010 activities and now that decided to merge with Chrysler we hope will benefit from so far Americans have got most of the benefits but at Melfi we will make new Jeep models that's positive isn't it
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0013 it would be bad for us if Melfi were to shut down and go to China but if they decide to make cars both in China and in Melfi that's great
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0018 Aldo Caprarella earns hundred euros a month some of these say that they are ready to accept market reforms such as more flexibility in order to keep their jobs
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0024 the danger is that new production lines will dramatically the car making potential of our five five hundred workers and even the redundancy Fund agreement doesn't make it clear that all the workers will get their jobs back after a twenty-four month period
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0039 economies will be the only beneficiaries of the outsourcing of production lines from Italy
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0040 Serbia for instance they are making a model that could have been produced in Italy
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0044 has built a new innovative plant on the site of the Zastava factory best known its former Yugo cars
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0045 damaged in the ninety-nine NATO bombing Zastava was bought up by in two thousand eight the plant now produces the new five hundred for the global market

20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0055 plant they earn between three fifty and four hundred euros per month slightly above the average Serbian salary
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0056 the old Zastava plant employed twenty-five workers but there were no machines and salaries were slightly lower than today
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0057 since the end of the war and the transition from the embargoed Socialist system to a market economy Serbian productivity has grown dramatically but according to
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0059 in Italy industrial relations are more developed when it comes to job contracts and workers' here Serbia is going through a different phase
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0061 and that there are no workers' rights it's just a different reality a different context so it is

20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0008 the vote doesn't bode well for a smooth transition rather a return to unstable governments that plagued Italy for decades

20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0018 many seems to be Grillo and that protest making it difficult to form a government
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0029 well they are and this vote the vote for Grillo is a kick in the pants for Italy's established parties one in four Italians voted for Beppe Grillo and his protest movement but unfortunately it solves nothing
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0031 over the coming weeks and that will hit Italy's rating and I fear will make the situation worse rather than better
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0036 not entirely unexpected have this situation structural reforms are never that popular
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0044 that say for EU policy because he was taking pro EU measures one in four people didn't vote that be indicative what they thought about the government before
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0057 why is such a reaction against well they were carrying out policy that many other countries in the European Union thought was good but also policy that the Italian parties themselves backed it was the stepping down of the Italian parties in recognition of their failure and putting in place of a technocratic government gave us some hope for the future of Italy but unfortunately those same parties or at least Mister Berlusconi's party decided to pull the plug on the whole thing just before Christmas and caused early elections how do you see that
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0058 I think what we're going to see now is that the markets are going to react badly we already seen
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0059 the reality that while Monti's reforms were not popular with the Italian people
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0079 down eventually by Berlusconi and Grill supporters I think a coalition
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0080 very difficult and very few people would trust Berlusconi particularly view of what he did in bringing down Mario government what I think
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0082 that Italian elected politicians recognising the need for a majority in both houses of parliament actually come together to form some new party some new alliance the
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0083 of taking Italy forward in the absence of that I think we'll have a period of drift increasing dissolution
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0087 part of the problem is that Berlusconi's character the kind of thing said
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0090 so I don't there is possibility for some of stable government to be formed without
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0102 any new government should be doing in Italy now I think if they want support of the financial markets which is be essential for investment
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0103 whatever government is formed has to give some commitment to carrying on with the tax reforms and the other structural reforms that Monti's government was pursuing
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0104 it's hard to see how will get those policies through government because even if there's a majority the chamber there's unlikely to be a majority in the upper house and Berlusconi is going to hold all the cards
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0127 I think the exact timing isn't clear but there will be new elections and we have to have a resolution
20130101_20130531_en_acnw-0001 leaders of non Christian faiths in Italy have been giving their reactions to Benedict's departure and looking to a new era despite angering many Muslims during his reign the last also made conciliatory gestures and some say inspired more intense dialogue between the two religions
20130101_20130531_en_acnw-0003 I think that our hope is to see communities of believers search together for solutions to the world's problems
20130101_20130531_en_acnw-0005 and above all to find common ground on which to work and in particular find universal values to which all believers can relate

20130101_20130531_en_adhb-0004 the problem is not agriculture whatever the size the problem is subsidies are distributed around farmers and not necessarily the farmers themselves

20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0002 the government says it was left with no choice and that the alternative was a losing Proposition now small account holders as well as large are dreading the pinch where it hurts most their wallets as currently stand Cyprus is waiting for ten billion euros in aid from the EU and the International Monetary Fund one of conditions is accounts than hundred euros be taxed at a rate of six
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0003 percent and above that at a rate of nine nine percent the island asked for seventeen billion euros which was cut back

20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0007 for the first time in a bailout bank depositors are having contribute has the European Union broken a taboo
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0008 I think you have to remember that the European had adopted a very clear principle of protecting people's
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0010 that clear principle set after the two thousand eight financial crisis in order to prevent contagion the collapse of Lehman brothers
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0013 the risk of contagion is limited because not talking about a big event but anyway the authorities must clearly state the principle that was
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0015 don't forget that this is a key principle of the EU banking union that is being set up so that's another reason to stick to this principle of protecting bank savings of Europe's small account holders
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0016 however Cyprus accounts for just two percent of Europe's GDP not much they are being lent ten billion euros is this not a sign that the eurozone countries and especially Germany are Fed just giving money and they want the countries concerned take some responsibility
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0018 but said that the loan must be provided under conditions that make Cyprus responsible as well there has to be an effort by the country
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0019 are we going to ask Cyprus's small investors to contribute and the big savers in Cyprus
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0024 exactly you mention Russian assets maybe fifteen to twenty billion euros perhaps dirty money
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0026 yes I think this bailout loan process in Cyprus should be used to make the Cypriot banks more
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0027 because in my opinion it is not good to use euro area banks for Russian investors' financial transactions that are clear so must clarify that I
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0031 is there a risk of uncertainty returning to the markets after they have been stable for several weeks
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0033 I'll say again we're facing a small economic and financial problem but we have to pay attention the psychological effects around this sensitive area that is protecting small savers' money
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0034 and therefore in my opinion a very clear message has to be sent as soon as possible by the European institutions starting with the European Central Bank
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0004 such as miracle cures for example others are hidden in places expect to find them in loans or between the lines of too good to be true promotions we
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0005 when I bought my computer nobody told that all consumer goods bought in Europe have an automatic two year guarantee
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0007 the directive return up to two years after purchase instead client a so called extended warranty that fact overlapped the free statutory two year warranty
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0012 I thought that what they told me was true so I signed and ended up paying much more than necessary I feel they've made a fool of me I feel duped and cheated
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0021 according the European directive there are two main categories of unfair commercial practices aggressive and misleading the latter be it through action omission pushes the average to take decisions he would not have taken misleading advertising is one example
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0030 the problem is that it was broadcast over a two year period and people believed it it's been censored but nobody reported that it wasn't in the papers or in other media so the advert worked
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0032 unfair commercial practices are everywhere and involve companies one wouldn't suspect Italian car giant for example was fined for promising motorists they would save lot of money on fuel if
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0033 car even Italy's government run train operator Trenitalia was sanctioned after it promoted euros tickets that were virtually impossible to get hold of
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0037 a typical example is telecommunication companies phone companies have been handed at least one fines they don't play fair and they don't change their ways
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0039 misleading advertising only a drop in the Ocean of unfair practices door to door selling for example can easily turn into aggressive practice
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0044 member states deplore a lack of resources the complexity of internal procedures and the absence of sanctions
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0049 the goal now is to harmonise its implementation in order to make sure that what you pay for is what you get
