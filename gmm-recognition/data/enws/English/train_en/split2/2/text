20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0007 if you like this budgetary pact refers to the lack of a political Europe
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0008 and it raises the question of what is happening with this integration process where democracy is being reduced within each member state without increasing democracy at the Federal level

20130101_20130531_en_adsd-0026 accept China's initiative to return to the six way negotiating table for denuclearising the peninsula but here we can really say it has ratcheted up the tension partly it's because there's a new leader and all the leaders in region
20130101_20130531_en_adsd-0027 there's a new team in China a new president in South Korea and new prime minister in Japan so it's important for
20130101_20130531_en_adsd-0029 but tension has also moved up a because he knows to use the media well and as I say needs to show who's boss

20130101_20130531_en_adti-0001 am Chris Burns and welcome to I talk some call strip mining of the seas over fishing that is wiping out fish stocks sometimes to the point of near extinction and what about the safety and quality of the fish we eat
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0005 a whole show that what is your prognosis positive negative of the economic situation we can be slightly
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0012 I am still optimistic why because we can a slight light now at the end of the tunnel for the first time Greece has a surplus and are some reforms ongoing and we are expecting
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0013 some tourists a lot of tourists actually this summer so going this way I think that at the end we are to earn the game but the difficulties are

20130101_20130531_en_adti-0031 we have heard almost a million of signatures for this so about discarding this is a huge problem now twenty-three percent is
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0038 so I think everybody now has understood that and we had a good approach in the Council between the ministers

20130101_20130531_en_adti-0045 trying this is the answer but we are not there yet so what we to do and this is
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0049 this what we call maximum sustainability so I can say that if our reform will be in place then we can have a very good prognosis because after
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0051 almost all stocks are going to be fished in a sustainable way and this means that
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0053 more jobs in the Fisheries sector and we can have also twenty-four additional income twenty-four percent for our fishermen that's another danger with overfishing
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0077 we are getting tougher because we really to control situation so we have a lot of instruments in our hands now

20130101_20130531_en_adti-0103 overfishing in Europe now that the Commission's proposal to cut over capacity by a quota trading system is off the table what solutions would you be looking in the CFP reform to over capacity
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0108 member states we a Fund it is taxpayers' money of course so we have to have some rules saying in a concrete way the member cannot get enough money from this pot

20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0006 French online newspaper Mediapart broke the story last December publishing a transcript
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0007 four long in which it alleged Cahuzac had said before big promotion what me that I still have an account open at
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0010 Cahuzac took libel action against Mediapart and he swore up and down it wasn't true he lied brazenly on camera on radio parliament in flagrante
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0012 I deny categorically the allegations on the Mediapart I have never ever had an account abroad
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0013 but police analysis of the voice in the recording stacked the case against him and when Cahuzac was placed under investigation the budget minister's fall was only a matter of time
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0015 cardiologist who had become a plastic before he became a politician and was appointed to lead
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0022 firstly what you think about the four months of lying by the former budget minister and his adamant denials publicly playing at offended and outraged
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0029 and what has happened is quite rigorously just the opposite so this political crisis is just getting started
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0031 he was the budget minister someone who is supposed to set an example to fight tax fraud
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0035 how to explain to the French people they have to make sacrifices when the height of state power these words are not being respected
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0036 political error goes down badly especially when ordinary people are having a difficult time but the lying has been seen as even worse the French showed this in their reactions this morning
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0039 and here they have the proof a minister confessing which is quite exceptional
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0045 can the do first can take offence explain that an individual was responsible that Prime Minister Ayrault didn't know that the president didn't know
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0046 that doesn't mean the president safe he didn't know what was going on thought Cahuzac was not guilty
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0047 the government's authority could suffer since it was already in grave danger in opinion polls
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0048 beyond case and this government investigations scandals been multiplying in political circles there's a feeling that everyone is
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0050 the French are demanding the truth yes but I think in way that stopped believing and the most serious thing of all we are in a political crisis which has gone so far as to become a moral crisis of democracy itself
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0051 I was going to ask you this discrediting of the political class is it good democracy
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0052 no obviously it can't be for democracy if the Cahuzac case affects the left today the right is equally affected by other scandals and build up of all of them risks going in favour of those who say that the whole political class is corrupt and we have try something different

20130101_20130531_en_adzq-0016 the political class all sides mixed together and an element of the media went along with Cahuzac in his lie
20130101_20130531_en_adzq-0019 and today we see this almost oligarchic world somewhere between politics money and the media
20130101_20130531_en_adzq-0025 quite simply it's a serious blow for the Republic shows that France is a low grade democracy
20130101_20130531_en_adzq-0028 a living democracy is one where you can only revelations but where once something is revealed the opposition swings into action and makes sure that justice prevails sanctions are imposed
20130101_20130531_en_adzq-0033 and not to take the State itself hostage by using the services of the State to protect himself
20130101_20130531_en_adzq-0034 it's that which has been dramatic in this and today we are paying the price and we'll have to respond to that with a big Democratic jolt

20130101_20130531_en_aefa-0016 have for instance us understand that there is a huge temperature variation due to the position of the swimming pool and its ventilation system there is around seven degrees Celsius difference between the north and the south facing sides so in space there is a huge variation in thermo hydrometric conditions these optimised sensors allow us to calculate that variation in an accurate affordable way
20130101_20130531_en_aefa-0017 data from the swimming pool and other sports areas was then sent to a central module to be analysed after checking complimentary data like weather forecasting or planned facility usage it can optimise energy consumption

20130101_20130531_en_aefa-0023 researchers think that once fully developed platform will allow sport facilities like this one to save up to thirty percent of their energy bills after just five years which is good news for sports facility owners

20130101_20130531_en_aeme-0030 that we are that it can go on and will go on even if the country is divided into two or even three blocks because a lot of Venezuelans do not support Chavismo's projects or support the opposition and that is where the struggle to win votes will concentrate

20130101_20130531_en_aent-0011 who feels that North Korea is going to launch any sort of military attack what they may do is test launch a missile
20130101_20130531_en_aent-0014 because never been tested and to do this around the birthday of founder Kim Il sung if it fails would be a great embarrassment but North Korea has kept everyone guessing and it is predictably unpredictable so no can actually predict what will happen but the chances of war seem extremely

20130101_20130531_en_aenu-0020 there's the information from the whole country to do it all the votes and we have the technical resources to verify the result
20130101_20130531_en_aenu-0021 this doesn't seem worrying to me I believe if the results have been tampered with then we need to correct
20130101_20130531_en_aenu-0022 not necessarily because one side or the other interfered but because they weren't correctly counted
20130101_20130531_en_aenu-0025 not a problem of being willing or not a question of applying written laws and rules and the electoral statutes
20130101_20130531_en_aenu-0026 reviewing the electoral process is so normal that in the past both candidates have accepted it the candidate of the opposition asked for it and the incumbent who was favoured to win according to the result accepted
20130101_20130531_en_aenu-0027 I imagine that seems strange if one is familiar with the electoral process in Venezuela going over the process here is not a rare thing
20130101_20130531_en_aenu-0032 I believe that we are facing a very close result and that for the good health and political future of Venezuela
20130101_20130531_en_aenu-0034 the mechanism to do that as I said is institutionalised legal and not of the ordinary it's true that it doesn't happen very often what usually happens is what did on seven October when he conceded that Chavez had won by a comfortable margin this time there were special interventions' in several voting stations there were cases where people were prevented from voting there were complaints of a of impartiality by members of the armed forces which could alter the result

20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0006 the economic crisis is affecting international art market like all sectors in a relative or differentiated way because art market has special characteristics
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0007 this market is surprising a market where there are only individuals individual collectors and individual objects
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0008 very special characteristics and therefore faced with a crisis we that masterpieces rare works with a prestigious provenance paintings are not affected by the
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0010 in contrast objects of lesser value interesting paintings but of less marked value can be affected by the crisis and their estimates should at this point extremely precise to enable us to sell them
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0012 there have been some auctions where works reach incredible prices is art always a good investment or is the risk of a bubble effect
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0013 true that the major auctions have been breaking records last year for example Sotheby's in New York sold a of Eduard Munch the Scream' famous work for more than one hundred twenty million
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0014 works of Picasso sold at auction in Paris for example a portrait of Dora Maar went for seven million euros
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0015 true that these figures suggest that the art market is a somewhat protected area a safe haven in times
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0016 the reality is more nuanced of course because again there are areas where there fewer buyers and worries about the global economic situation may be

20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0021 some other sectors have experienced in recent years a very rapid development such as the of Africa and
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0023 another area that seen a dramatic development is Asian art only a dozen years ago the art market was a reserved primarily for Western clients Europeans and Americans
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0024 in recent Asian buyers including the Chinese came to the market a huge appetite for buying works of their history imperial works seals jades and ceramics
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0027 the identity of the buyers the profile of the buyers in the art market has evolved in recent years a dozen years ago the typical profile of the collector was a Western one a European an American
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0028 today the typical profile is difficult to say because there are buyers from Russia China India and America who have increased the number of potential customers on top of the Americans and Europeans who still there
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0030 in addition secondary sectors have highly developed in recent years take for example photography or the art of Africa
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0033 of new buyers younger a different from what we had in the more traditional sectors ten years ago
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0037 it was a time when France Paris were still from the point of view of creativity and the density of artists a must
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0038 and then there were extremely important auction houses and dealers that dominated the world at a time when the art market was still relatively small
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0039 it was a coexistence of national markets and throughout the eighties nineties and since two thousand the market became international
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0045 the action moved to countries and sales places that are dynamic to attract buyers and create large events around sales
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0051 objects that are sold on the art market as well the collectors involved in the art market are mobile
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0052 an object can be sold in Paris but its owner can also decide to sell it very easily in London or Geneva
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0053 a collector can choose to buy at an auction in Paris but can also buy in London Geneva or New York today with international technology the internet sending catalogues communications made by auction houses
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0059 we had like other sectors a crisis in two thousand eight two thousand nine crisis of confidence and so the market shrank we rebounded strongly developed well in ten eleven
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0061 was a little down and thirteen watching carefully because I think there are risk factors we must be cautious in estimating the that are on sale because the horizon of all the economic operators but also our customers is under scrutiny people are not making long term plans they see that this year is undeniably difficult at a European level so they are cautious our role this context is to adapt ourselves by making extremely attractive estimations to generate trust

20130101_20130531_en_aesv-0004 of the founding elements of Europe it's even one of the main reasons the creation of the Union is desire to never see again on the European continent the advent of authoritarian xenophobic or racist regimes like the ones we saw between
20130101_20130531_en_aesv-0010 and then the European Union the Commission or the Parliament can only take stock of the results of these

20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0006 Italy is still in a political impasse months after it held legislative elections
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0007 its institutional stalemate is the product of the seemingly unsolvable puzzle of the February ballot

20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0024 it was impossible eighty-seven year old Giorgio Napolitano nearing the end of his term as President of the Republic to call fresh elections to try to unblock the logjam and so Italy was in an institutional paralysis as it sank further into the economic mud
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0025 in a joint session of the chamber of deputies and the Senate along with special regional electors it took six rounds of voting for the political blocs to produce a

20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0032 Napolitano has accepted the invitation of the country's two main political coalitions to serve again for a new term
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0033 in return however Napolitano has asked the parties to hold themselves accountable Italians are wondering how these politicians can possibly keep such a promise given that in recent months the image they have presented has been so bad
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0036 I think they allow the new government at least one year in which to do several much needed things
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0044 you've mentioned Europe in your opinion what kind of message is Italy sending the EU by re instating Napolitano
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0045 the message is remember we have an excellent President of the Republic with a high international standing a man you can
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0047 who represents very well a country that has a lot of problems to solve here he is please your
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0049 at moment the favourite as Prime Minister seems to be Giuliano Amato do you think that Amato in the coming months will be able to carry out both the institutional and
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0051 Giuliano Amato is very appreciated by the President and I'm sure that Napolitano will give him the full support of his
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0053 Amato has an international profile he is fluent in English and he is a Treasury minister
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0057 the president's backing and a of responsibility from the different parties Amato will be able move ahead with those reforms that have been outlined already and which need to be completed in no more a year
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0058 otherwise we risk huge delay a failure to fulfil commitments and that could accentuate speculation against Italy by the markets
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0060 if very Soon' means within three to six months I'd say no I think we should give the government one year's time
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0061 government in any country even in the most efficient democracies can carry long term projects if it allowed survive for less than a year the problem is we need to rebuild our country
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0063 but in that time we can make progress on some of the guidelines which are already there which have been wisely outlined for Italy by the European Commission
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0064 we can pull ourselves together this can be done all the rest will depend obviously on the approval the government manages to earn and its ability to accomplish tasks but also on the backing the different parties will to grant Amato

20130101_20130531_en_aeuz-0009 about the European market's continued decline in March Peugeot Citroen sales fell sixteen percent year on year what are you doing to halt that seemingly never ending decline
20130101_20130531_en_aeuz-0010 the European Automobile market is down by twenty five percent between two thousand seven and twelve that represents four million fewer cars being bought by customers in Europe and we really see no signs that us hope of a rebound
20130101_20130531_en_aeuz-0011 this year we think the market will drop by around five percent and see no signs of a rebound this year or next year including in Germany
20130101_20130531_en_aeuz-0012 do those poor sales figures for March in Europe mean that Peugeot will have to consider more job losses at its plants on top of those that have already been announced
20130101_20130531_en_aeuz-0013 it's obvious that unfortunately because of the major recession in Europe having to restructure the company in Europe it's very difficult to take these huge decisions and we try to do that in the most

20130101_20130531_en_aeuz-0020 yes I believe that internationalisation and producing more upscale models are the two keys to success
20130101_20130531_en_aeuz-0021 the first will make us less dependent on Europe and increase our presence in growth markets and where car sales are growing

20130101_20130531_en_aexn-0034 they continued to sell those products and the management gave orders that they should presented as if they were long term deposits that could be easily cashed in
20130101_20130531_en_aexn-0035 the bosses of those companies created this concept the strategy the type of contract and especially the means of gaining control of their customers'
20130101_20130531_en_aexn-0037 those preferred shares were sold at too high a price could those sales be annuled and what consequences would that have for Spain's bank restructuring

20130101_20130531_en_aexn-0041 the regulator said that reasonable price based on what the former boss Rodrigo didn't reveal would have been twenty percent less but Bankia continued to sell the shares at the original price with regard to the bank restructuring that the government is doing with its banking bailout and reconstruction programme it's clear that the only solution is to use what remains of hundred billion euros from Brussels and return money to the people who were victims of this scam
20130101_20130531_en_aexn-0042 the well known of the former managers is Rato former chairman of Bankia and former head of the International Monetary Fund he appeared in court in December a defendant in case how that legal process going to end

20130101_20130531_en_aexn-0046 it's clearly enough I guess the government feels guilty and Brussels wasn't told about the criminal way these toxic products were sold I suppose that the government's conscience was pricked was the only reason it is giving back a little bit of money otherwise its behavior is incomprehensible
20130101_20130531_en_aexn-0047 the government knows that eventually the evidence presented to the court will mean all the purchase contracts will have to be cancelled and all money returned

20130101_20130531_en_afct-0014 Brussels is proposing a new regulation aimed at reducing the money time and energy spent on authenticating official documents used across European borders
20130101_20130531_en_afct-0015 this would affect hundreds of thousands of cases involving individuals and businesses
20130101_20130531_en_afct-0016 met a French pilot and his partner who know all the stress of administrative red tape
20130101_20130531_en_afct-0017 they settled in Vienna five years ago but are still not sure they have beaten the paperwork
20130101_20130531_en_afct-0018 for example they have had to register the births of two of their three children and sign up for social security
20130101_20130531_en_afct-0020 every time we do official paperwork we're not sure if we're doing everything within our rights because we're foreigners when actually of course we have the same rights
20130101_20130531_en_afct-0022 also we have the impression that we're a nuisance either because of the queue behind us or because the kids are noisy or because we're not the only ones filling in papers and we take more time the officials in front of us
20130101_20130531_en_afct-0023 so we up saying damn we have annoyed them we have been a real nuisance' at the of the day they're not there for us normally they're there to help Austrian people
20130101_20130531_en_afct-0024 very unsettling because we realise if we make a mistake when establishing a civil status document this will stay with the child throughout his life
20130101_20130531_en_afct-0025 so we try to focus to understand as precisely as possible what we need to provide in terms of documents and we totally rely on the officials the other side of the counter
20130101_20130531_en_afct-0026 we get the impression that even they are a bit lost and not sure about the validity of what they are doing
20130101_20130531_en_afct-0027 this plants a seed of doubt and worry and we wonder but who we go to who's responsible for these procedures

20130101_20130531_en_afct-0041 that's simplification however given there are different legal standards in place simplification does not mean having everything automatically recognised
20130101_20130531_en_afct-0042 but Brussels says the regulation will not force countries to recognise a document's contents which some had been calling for

20130101_20130531_en_afct-0046 the situations we face build up and make us fragile and that's when we lose our confidence

20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0001 bees to horse meat to ageing populations an eclectic mix of issues yet all in one man's portfolio and to top it all a smattering of controversy and scandal it's certainly been a busy six months in office
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0003 this week is Mister Tonio Borg who is the EU Commissioner for health and consumer policy many thanks for joining us
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0006 from East Flanders I like to know what the European Union is doing prevent horse meat from being sold as
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0007 you have just presented a new set of EU food safety proposals but to wait two thousand sixteen until they are adopted into law possibly what happens in the meantime of all horse meat scandal was a safety issue
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0013 we already have dissuasive and appropriate punishment applied by member states we are going to increase the
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0015 legislating to the effect that the pecuniary penalty to be equal to the economic gain made out of the violation of
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0016 and then be other inspections unannounced and also the Commission will be able to oblige member states to do the testing I must say testing DNA was done by all member states beyond the number suggested I guess that you must be expecting something like to happen again possibly in the near future because this is the result of an economic crisis where suppliers are squeezed financially to provide cheaper and cheaper
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0020 he or she is caught and that that person is judged by the state courts in the member states I must say that the entire scandal was discovered through enforcement by a member state in this case
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0022 rat meat is being sold as lamb now given that we've got a confusion in our food chain here in Europe can you be sure that we're not being sold Chinese meat here
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0023 conduct inspections outside the European Union so that importation of food products from outside the
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0024 to come from certain approved sites sometimes even approved regions so this is the
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0029 can I mean even three Summers ago there was the importation of vegetables from outside the
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0034 everything can happen but I think we have one of the best food safety systems in the world and one of the best labelling
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0038 hello name is I'm from Latvia my question is how can ensure the new
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0041 this isn't actually a ban yet it's a suspension I think for two years but how monitor this it's
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0042 there was resistance against this ban but there was an absolute majority in favour there the qualified majority in favour neither against in which case the Commission proceeds with ban and that is law so it will be
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0045 fighting a very powerful lobby the pesticide lobby and been arguing that over the course of five years if this ban were to go to years this the economy like
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0046 seventeen billion euros something like fifty jobs what do you say to that I must say that
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0048 the ban the ban itself and these economic apocalyptic consequences did not result so we have to protect our bees because bees are doing this pollination
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0064 this is a good question isn't it because in less than years it's estimated that a third of European
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0067 in these times of economic crisis there will be cuts budgets as I mean this will be normal so rather than whining about these cuts one has to
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0073 partnership on healthy ageing which we promote the European Commission but also have to discover new means of cutting costs and retaining
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0075 it would be something very if all member states would indulge in this
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0080 monitored your health situation is monitored from the centre and you remain at home would be beneficial
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0081 for those who have reached a certain age rather than going to clinics and covering these distances would be
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0089 we had in the multi annual financial programme but you accept that now in this period of economic people aren't really able to afford healthcare and we possibly see a
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0097 now not only in our economies but also in our health systems then we are inviting
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0102 very strong in the health sector so actually coordinate
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0107 the troika has actually slashed spending on health in Greece and Portugal yes as well which does not mean slashing directly
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0111 slightly off topic you were elected Commissioner there was some controversy over your personal views particularly same sex
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0112 divorce what you say to your detractors who said that your personal values would affect policy
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0114 certain respects as regards animal welfare as regards other issues as well and I have respected the principle of subsidiarity that is to say in most matters which you have mentioned are the
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0115 member states and not of the Commission and your personal values will not influence policy making values are my personal values they are important in the same way other commissioners have their personal values but we here as commissioners and we apply EU

20130101_20130531_en_afpe-0016 and perhaps now this is turning back because people did not vote for a conventional pop song for Eurovision but for a song that means a lot many people

20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0005 it's been a momentous at Manchester United with Sir Alex Ferguson finally deciding to retire and we know his successor will be David Moyes from Everton now Sir Alex was in a League of his own having stayed at the helm for nearly twenty-seven years so how a task is David Moyes facing to talk to about those issues now is Joe Allen from our sports Joe
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0006 what we expect from David Moyes it is a tough challenge for anybody it tough challenge
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0011 that is required to manage this team well and I think that's been helped by

20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0047 without a doubt new pressure be facing not only with dealing with a dressing room full of stars but also there's going be pressure from the top and I'm thinking Sir Alex Ferguson

20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0073 and I think again that legacy that Ferguson has left behind no man is bigger than the club I think Moyes will carry that

20130101_20130531_en_agby-0015 patients with head trauma are provided with strange plastic glasses to measure the pressure on brain tissues
20130101_20130531_en_agby-0016 until now these measurements key to determining if patients at risk of further brain damage involved literally drilling skull

20130101_20130531_en_agby-0112 far more is still needed researchers conclude before they can solve the many scientific puzzles still posed by our fragile sophisticated and virtually amazing brain

20130101_20130531_en_agcb-0021 now there is always little more luck compared to other sectors of the economy they're more affected
20130101_20130531_en_agcb-0022 we also think going to the movies also costs fortunately we can go into a cinema and not pay very much this is not the most expensive hobby and get a

20130101_20130531_en_agev-0009 Rafsanjani registering as a candidate at the last minute upset many political factions and ruined their plans
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0012 triggered spontaneous protests and violent repression severely damaging the ruling system's credentials
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0016 this should be our sacred objective not necessary in the current circumstances keep some people in prison for alleged activities they should be allowed to rejoin their families
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0017 Rafsanjani was speaker of Parliament for nine years from eighty-nine ninety-seven he was President of Iran alongside Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0020 it was his biggest defeat this time supporters hoped he'd come back to save the and to stop the downward slide in relations with the US the EU and powerful countries but the clerics have had a turbulent eight years with Ahmadinejad they want a president who will go along with them

20130101_20130531_en_agev-0025 Rafsanjani has had a very important role in the formation of the Islamic Republic yet in spite of this was disqualified how you see
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0027 on the one hand Rafsanjani's disqualification is in fact a disqualification of the Islamic revolution in which he had a substantial role
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0028 at least until his second term as president he was one of the top decision makers of the regime
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0029 after that he has held posts as head of the Expediency Council and head of the House of experts and these are very important posts in the Islamic Republic
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0030 on the other hand in fact he has disqualified the order of Supreme leader Khamenei which seems in probability to be the case it can be said that
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0036 some social and political personalities including daughter Ayatollah Khomeini the founder of the Islamic Republic have asked the leader to intervene and a state to bring Rafsanjani into the elections probable do you think that is

20130101_20130531_en_agev-0051 with Mashaie and their supporters would rouse some sort of reactions in society
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0053 those concerns may still be there as far as we know the Guardian Council has decided firmly it is a risk worth taking
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0054 we will within the next few whether or not this is Khamenei's decision it seems very probable that he has decided to disqualify Mashaie
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0056 that he not have to go through the headache of the next two presidential terms Mashaie

20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0023 over whether the first thing to do is to place the stress on putting the public finances into working order
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0034 but it has distanced the risk of catastrophe thanks to the decisions it has taken governments the European institutions and the Central Bank
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0035 therefore we are now at a stage where we absolutely must consolidate everything which might permit a return to growth
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0036 what lesson can we from the Greek or Cypriot crisis perhaps some economies were too feeble to be into the euro zone or are the stronger euro zone economies not ready to pay a high cost to protect the poorer members
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0040 fortunately relatively numerous that are competitive that sell their goods and services comfortably on the domestic European and world markets
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0041 and have good reasons for that because they have a good grip on their costs and structural
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0043 and then there are countries that have mastered their costs far less well and which have not reformed structurally
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0045 so I believe that the great lesson is that there has to be a staggering improvement in the economic and budgetary governance
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0047 it has to be very firm when this or that becomes dangerous to itself and to the entire zone
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0068 I believe that works it hasn't worked in the past and I don't think it will in the future
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0069 instead what I myself as realistically imaginable is instead of fines
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0074 and the European Parliament with its members elected by direct universal suffrage
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0081 then the European Parliament decides evidently limited to representatives of the euro zone and after contact with the national parliaments
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0083 but they respect the principle of subsidiarity because this is not applied generally it would only be in absolutely exceptional cases and when the stability of the whole is in question
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0085 the ultimate decision is taken by representatives of the people and that makes it relatively certain that these are not just empty words
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0087 is an alignment being formed in Europe notably with France Italy and Spain who are adopting an approach of reasoning by dialogue with the policy German Chancellor Angela Merkel
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0096 that it has dealt with and responded to a way that is indisputable when we look at everything that has been done at this terribly difficult time
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0003 at a Bangladesh clothing factory to ensure such a disaster does not happen again
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0004 global union brings together nine hundred unions representing fifteen million workers worldwide has been pushing for
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0006 consumers are asking for cheaper and cheaper goods we've already seen another factory collapse in Cambodia do you think you can ensure such a disaster doesn't happen again
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0015 we have more than forty of the major retail global brands signed up to legally binding agreement this matters this is different and this is going to have an impact
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0016 all those European consumers even in the midst of a recession even at a time of squeeze are you prepared to pay penny or
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0019 children and of mothers working in factory conditions would be unacceptable to every single European Union citizen we've had enough they've had enough and that's why this agreement is in place to
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0022 why you get retailers to sign up to an agreement in all the countries they operate in
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0023 one of the issues going to have to discuss is how do we this a broader based agreement but given the factory collapse
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0025 more than two lives have been lost in Bangladesh given that in Bangladesh this is a sector employing four million people in four factories that was the critical issue but help is coming and help is on the way for all of those other countries I think it is inevitable that we broaden discussion
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0027 name is Nicolas and I am French which big companies haven't yet signed up to the accord for Bangladesh
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0032 is in the United States of America we do have Abercrombie Fitch we have Calvin Klein we Tommy
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0036 supermarket chain is Walmart they employ two million people they are the supply chain experts they know how to
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0037 every grain out of the supply chain to reduce costs they've refused said they do their own thing
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0038 be their own judge and jury they are the new flag of convenience to themselves in this process and
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0040 likes to present itself trendy contemporary responsible I know going on in gap
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0042 for a side agreement just for them and we've simply refused the US National retail federation has said that the agreement you have worked upon lacks and I quote here common sense' is particularly problematic for the US what do you say to that
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0051 and they are saying this lacks common sense we are talking about life and death here the common sense is about doing what we can together private and union with government to improve the quality of life for the Bangladeshis that's common sense but it's also the common good if you are talking about life and death then it could argued that you've been quite intransigent in the negotiation process wouldn't it have been better to get a bit of a broader coalition retailers on board and
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0059 you or your listeners or viewers get the impression that this is somehow a marginal event that it have a critical mass that
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0064 are not properly enforceable where there is no transparency all we get vague promises yes things will improve
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0074 the European Union making a wishy washy statement about we must do more to implement improve labour standards in Bangladesh is not enough
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0077 the social Affairs Commissioner should say we support this agreement we support the business community and Industri all
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0078 global union to ensure this applied the European Union has to stop the race to the bottom
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0080 of this race to the bottom where basically these Bangladeshi workers are surviving on thirty-eight dollars a
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0082 all I can do and the ETUC the European trade Union movement will use their best persuasive powers to ensure that this will happen in practice and the European Union could put more

20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0088 that this at the end of the day is making the world of turn turn for business but at the end of the day for the people who are toiling in intolerable conditions that they will get a better life

20130101_20130531_en_agge-0009 the time would for the ground to send a command to that machine in case something goes wrong would be too late
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0014 is the European astronaut centre all astronauts heading to the ISS have to train
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0027 it's too fast and not too slow should something go wrong I am the last line of defence and I can send a command to stop
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0030 and then watched as they work if a European is in space there is always someone in Cologne to keep a careful eye
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0033 the astronauts on the International space station follow steady pre defined rhythm of work and rest to make sure get
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0035 to pace yourself of course in the beginning you're very excited you want to do everything very quickly but it doesn't work you can't maintain this rhythm for six months you have to yourself and you have to try to maintain
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0046 part of that experiment their bodies and minds studied and recorded we explore how humans adapt to in space
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0047 one of the ongoing experiments on the ISS called energy and Luca Parmitano is one of the subjects with tests
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0055 optimise food allotments for example for long term spaceflights and to better understand what the really needs on long term spaceflights
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0062 for reason one of the central of research is to understand how our body reacts to living in zero
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0067 and that is the big danger that they lose bone mass over time it's in the order of one to two percent per month so after six months you already lost a significant
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0069 the only hope to maintain muscle and bone is to do exercise cycling jogging and weightlifting
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0070 the bones of an astronaut who spends six months in space will take six months to recover
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0080 so all of small that you normally use you don't use any more in weightlessness I mean we do a lot sports even
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0086 space itself and all the highly charged particles of radiation that bombard the
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0087 of course very well aware the long term medical effects that space flight have yes you have a higher level of radiation there

20130101_20130531_en_agge-0091 that kind of radiation exposure could lead to cancers such as leukemia but for the moment the medical team to find any long term effects of spaceflight
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0094 the astronauts all the data worldwide of all astronauts put into a database we try
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0095 to identify specific medical issues that be related to the occupation of an
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0096 an occupation with risks also huge rewards and the view from the window is this a
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0104 the biggest concern is to try and make it count for every second to create memories while they are up there
20130101_20130531_en_aggf-0001 European football's governing UEFA has toughened up it's stance on racism within the game and introduced a minimum ten match ban for any players or officials found guilty of racist abuse

20130101_20130531_en_aghn-0011 the number of religious in Turkey is increasing all the time but some people are questions about the role of religion in education and the goals of some of these religious schools
20130101_20130531_en_aghn-0016 but whether Islamic schools are simply a way of preserving cultural traditions or whether they have another agenda remains a topic of debate

20130101_20130531_en_agho-0010 in Interior they've been averaging four five degrees below normal so people kept the heating going an extra tank of fuel for that cost family four hundred forty-five euros at ninety cents a litre
20130101_20130531_en_agho-0011 this has meant a five ten percent rise in electricity consumption compared to previous years similarly for combustible pellets
20130101_20130531_en_agho-0012 just like for fuel customers we've had quite a few stocking up on a few extra sacks of pellets to finish the winter and unlike normal years we're still getting requests to install fire

20130101_20130531_en_agho-0025 is that the we have an anticyclone over the Middle of the Atlantic Ocean that is channelling depressions via Iceland directly to Western Europe
20130101_20130531_en_agho-0026 these are cold airstreams often disturbed often unstable so we will keep getting below normal temperatures today for example we are seeing a temperature ten degrees Celsius the average for this season and
20130101_20130531_en_agho-0032 you need to know is cold in Western Europe it is very warm in places like Russia Finland where the temperatures could get as high as twenty-five thirty degrees Celsius it's often like that in Europe when there is a really long period of cold in one part there are very warm temperatures on the opposite side of the
20130101_20130531_en_agho-0038 this the question every meteorologist dream of answering there is no link between a cold spring and a summer or the opposite atmospheric circulation means you can experience many different weather conditions in a relatively short time
20130101_20130531_en_agho-0039 you could get subtropical conditions developing mean temperatures of around twenty-five thirty degrees for France and the Benelux countries
20130101_20130531_en_agho-0040 but to get this we would need an anticyclone over the centre of Europe Bulgaria example and then we here would have rising hot air which would last three weeks

20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0006 the charter brings together a wide range of principles into one document and raising awareness about how it can be used effectively is a key challenge
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0007 it is legally binding on EU states but only when they apply European law
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0010 to the Belgian capital to talk to some of those most likely to come the charter in their work
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0013 to put that to the test caught up with some workers at a new independent legal help centre set up in January
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0014 the EU rights clinic is a joint venture between the NGO European citizen action service and Kent University in Brussels
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0016 however in my daily work in my work here at the European rights clinic I'm not going to look at the charter as my first text of reference
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0020 we can make use of some of those rights in work here at the citizens' House rights clinic we can use rights such as the freedom of movement for citizens which now a fundamental right enshrined in the document
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0021 we can use as a reference for legal services in so far as giving legal advice to people in order to them as as in our advocacy
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0022 in a new progress report on the charter the European Commission says national courts are increasingly referring to the document
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0025 says the number of cases where the EU Court of justice has quoted the text in its judgements almost doubled last year
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0026 infringement proceedings against Malta and Hungary are also given as examples of where the principles of the charter have been
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0027 the report also shows what fundamental rights issues were most raised correspondence with the European Commission
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0028 top of the list was freedom of movement and residence followed by the functioning of national justice systems and access to justice then the right to choose an occupation and work
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0030 but still it seems a lot has to be to make sure the charter is better understood and more widely used
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0031 rights organisations argue that while it a crucial document the question of exactly who is bound by it and under circumstances remains difficult to work
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0034 also ask for more preliminary rulings but at the same time it also indicates there is room improvement because what is needed is further clarification of the scope of charter we all that it refers to actions undertaken European institutions or to EU law when it's applied on
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0035 level what this exactly means is still not clear even for the courts this is also the reason why they're asking for preliminary rulings
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0036 the charter will soon move in other directions coming into force in Croatia for example when it joins the EU in July

20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0021 European leaders and the IMF were saying for months that a country the size of Cyprus can't have a banking sector which is eight times the size of its GDP
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0022 Cyprus's economy was largely on its banking sector given the Eurogroup's decision do you think that the danger of a national default has been completely overcome
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0030 a very healthy banking system was led to the of collapse endangering us with default on our national commitments

20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0039 not to think that the European system of independent central banks opposes mutual respect
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0042 however the actions of central bank governors affect the policies of elected governments
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0043 therefore there should be mutual respect between an elected leadership and an independent appointed official
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0045 let's look at another unresolved matter of importance for Cyprus reunification recently there have been some diplomatic and political moves all sides involved from Turkey the EU and even NATO
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0047 I'd like to ask you about report from the United Nations special adviser on Cyprus Alexander Downer what exactly does it say do you accept its findings
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0049 I have to say that it is nothing but description of what was done from two thousand eight until twelve
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0051 but it is not in any way a basis on which we are going to pursue the negotiations nor we are bound by any convergence which was successfully accomplished in past
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0053 that is correct but that doesn't mean we will the points on which we agree which do give us a foundation
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0056 of course that doesn't mean there is either numerical or quantitative equality when we look at participation in the exploitation and development of sources of income
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0057 the Secretary General of NATO has said that drilling will begin only after Cyprus's division is resolved what do you say to that
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0058 nobody can define our sovereign rights and connect them to our national solution we do want a solution we want Liberation we want reunification with peaceful co existence
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0060 but you cannot achieve that through the pressure of blackmail I don't speak NATO's Anders Rasmussen
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0061 but if you to the benefits of exploiting natural gas resources you shouldn't have to agree to an unacceptable solution
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0075 to conclude what would you the people of Cyprus we all know they are suffering and expecting hard times ahead
