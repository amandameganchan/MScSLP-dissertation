20130101_20130531_en_aadj-0028 how can the situation in Venezuela evolve and which path of development will the country now take to see this more clearly we're joined from Moscow by Professor Boris Martynov assistant Director of the Latin American Institute within the Russian Academy of
20130101_20130531_en_aadj-0029 January ten scheduled inauguration of Hugo Chavez not many believe he will show up what's next should we expect new elections as the constitution states or the ceremony will be simply postponed
20130101_20130531_en_aadj-0030 I think that the constitutional norms will be followed to the letter anything else will just harm the interests of the authorities
20130101_20130531_en_aadj-0032 it can be either the continuity scenario when Chavez hands over all power to Vice President Maduro calls the next elections in thirty days
20130101_20130531_en_aadj-0034 to the newly elected speaker of National Assembly but who all the same sets the next elections in thirty days according to constitution
20130101_20130531_en_aadj-0036 yes the opposition can more active because for example in spite of all Chavez's victories it's managed to make some serious progress first of all by finding a common candidate
20130101_20130531_en_aadj-0037 as for the extreme scenarios as I earlier it can only harm Venezuela's position the country is firmly integrated in Latin Anerican structures where democracy is the proclaimed norm

20130101_20130531_en_aadj-0048 diverse this left flank is it's characterised by powerful state structures with strong social component
20130101_20130531_en_aadj-0050 I think that while following in that development mould Venezuela will gradually shred this Chavez Ian radicalism his

20130101_20130531_en_aadn-0002 the first of all Europe is heavily involved financially in resolution of this conflict since it funds half of the annual aid to the Palestinian authority

20130101_20130531_en_aadn-0009 so we often only reach a weak consensus rather strong decisions like the United States where of course power is much more centralised in the hands of one man
20130101_20130531_en_aadn-0011 for example the United States voted against the Palestinian authority obtaining observer status at the UN whereas EU heavyweights such as France Spain and Italy all voted in favour the rest abstained and only one country voted against the Czech Republic

20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0014 well it's forty years since Ireland first joined what was then the European economic community
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0018 contributed to the bringing in of a lot of laws like for example equal pay and equality legislation a lot of our environmental legislation had its origins in Europe so it's been a very positive experience OK let's go to a second question for the deputy prime minister
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0020 I would like to know which plans has to solve the flag crisis northern Ireland and how you expect to manage the rise of nationalism
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0021 Europe so Maria would like to know what you think about nationalism you must be a bit concerned by recent events in Belfast
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0022 yes indeed we are and I think what it shows is the need for constant vigilance to work on our
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0023 we had a conflict in northern Ireland which lasted for about thirty years was a very violent conflict three
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0028 we worked on peace process the Irish and the British government together with the political parties in northern Ireland which brought about a settlement and the establishment of a shared administration in northern Ireland we have however seen in recent weeks
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0029 which are worrying I hope that they not last but I think it shows the challenges that we have to build a shared future for people in northern Ireland I think it also shows the degree to which national identity and other identities are very strong throughout Europe the European Union has been successful
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0032 have very strong national or regional identity and I think important that we first of all respect those identities but that is mutual respect all round
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0038 I think it's important that we all recognise that the European Union is made up not of any one state or indeed a small number of large states the European Union is made up twenty-seven member states and
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0044 of all of the member states working together of there being mutual respect between smaller states large states
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0053 comes from our interdependence big strength that the European Union has is that there are five hundred million people in the European Union is the biggest consumer
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0057 our currency and with financial system I think we have to move beyond those problems now and concentrate on getting economic growth in Europe building on the strengths
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0059 that we are interdependent on each other it's not case one state or a number of
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0062 is the first presidency of the next trio with Ireland Lithuania and Greece and I would to know you are going to do to make sure you have a strong cohesion and a good cooperation between those three countries in difficult economic times
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0065 yes as far as the rotating presidency concerned of course there is also the presidency of the European Council a permanent institution president Van Rompoy and of course President the Commission president Barroso
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0066 and the high representative for Foreign and security I think the new trio arrangement
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0067 the presidency works with the two succeeding presidencies in Ireland's case that will mean we will be working with Lithuania and Greece gives continuity to our work there is a particular agenda that will have to be driven forward in the next six months and Ireland is very conscious of that we

20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0083 a number of initiatives that Ireland intends to take during the European Union presidency among them is bringing forward the
20130101_20130531_en_aajm-0084 of youth guarantee in other words that young people will have access to employment to work experience or to education and training the worst situation that young people can be left in in a state of idleness

20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0001 premeditation behind the killing of three Kurdish activists in Paris caused many to ponder on the motives behind the murders
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0002 one thing is certain the deaths and the manner of the killings a single bullet to the head of two of the women a third was hit in the chest and head suggests something more than a botched burglary
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0004 our correspondent in Paris Giovanni is at the scene of the killings as security forces begin their complex and no doubt international investigation into the triple murder
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0005 we saw a crowd of distraught Kurds protesting against the killings you have spoken to them what are their feelings about the deaths
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0007 we in the centre of Paris where a large Kurdish community lives since morning when the news broke hundreds made their way here
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0010 the fact that this violence was carried out against women three women activists it emphasises the shock and level of violence involved
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0011 for the hundreds here there been moments of reflection an unreal silence
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0016 there already a number of being put forward the murders with ramifications beyond French borders where will French investigators begin the probe
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0018 firstly we have to be careful as the investigation has started
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0021 so the police will be looking into those who want to derail any peace process
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0031 we already know one of the victims is a close associate of the imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan what do know her
20130101_20130531_en_aajp-0041 the death of such a high profile victim suggests a political motive behind
20130101_20130531_en_aajq-0001 Kurdish activists have suggested the Turkish state was responsible for the women's murders a senior member of the ruling party in Turkey has blamed internal feuding within the PKK
20130101_20130531_en_aajq-0005 if the fundamental is see the collapse of this complicated difficult process which will be very long if this is the objective of those behind the murders we can only hope that they will not succeed obviously this Kurdish issue' in Turkey is the main challenge for Turkey to finally be able to pursue its
20130101_20130531_en_aajq-0009 as far as Paris is concerned is true that for a number of years there have been many cases of revolutionary taxes
20130101_20130531_en_aajq-0012 remember the PKK is classed a terrorist organisation not only by France but also by the European Union by the United States and by Turkey which goes saying
20130101_20130531_en_aajq-0013 the anti terrorist arm of the Paris prosecutors' Department has conducted several operations and inquiries which have led some arrests and convictions of people charge of the PKK who were implicated in illegal financial operations
20130101_20130531_en_aajq-0014 so not entirely new for this financial dimension to be present in the PKK's activities in France and in Paris
20130101_20130531_en_aajr-0001 the visit of President Hamid Karzai for talks in Washington with Obama marks the beginning of the end of negotiations between the two countries on the
20130101_20130531_en_aajr-0005 three fundamental talking points are how many American troops will remain in Afghanistan after bulk of the military withdraw immunity from prosecution for US military serving in Afghanistan and peace talks between Kabul and moderate Taliban clans
20130101_20130531_en_aajr-0006 so how many troops will remain in theatre after American mandate ends in fourteen the debate is still raging in the corridors of power the top US commander in the region Marine Corps General John Allen has a force of between six and fifteen
20130101_20130531_en_aajr-0007 according to sources the Defense Department has drawn up a plan which will leave between three

20130101_20130531_en_aajr-0013 those in the know Karzai have some room for manoeuvre on this but it depends on what
20130101_20130531_en_aajr-0015 last but not least some form of Taliban involvement in the political process is key to prevent the country from slipping back into violence as soon as US troops pack
20130101_20130531_en_aajr-0016 informal meetings have already taken place on this issue last month in Chantilly France members of the high Council for peace in Afghanistan the Taliban and others took part in a seminar on the future of Afghanistan
20130101_20130531_en_aajr-0017 both leaders want and need a win win outcome Karzai wants to look less like a US puppet back home and Obama needs a smooth withdrawal to justify his decision to pull out of the country

20130101_20130531_en_aarm-0024 that's what we are doing our profession but at the same time we all a responsibility
20130101_20130531_en_aarn-0001 has had its wings clipped for the first time a decade the French based company has lost its crown as the world's largest maker of passenger jets to rivals Boeing
20130101_20130531_en_aarn-0002 sales of its flagship superjumbo a three eighty the airliner in the world were around one third of the company's target figure after a problem with wings of the aircraft but Airbus is confident of future as airlines look to replace their fleets with more fuel efficient planes
20130101_20130531_en_aarn-0003 in two thousand twelve we had a very good year which was better than expected we remain the market leader both in terms of the backlog of orders with orders for close to four
20130101_20130531_en_aarn-0004 hundred aircraft on our books that's seven years of production and that year after year we continued to increase our deliveries our speed of delivery to our customers
20130101_20130531_en_aarn-0005 despite buoyant tone sales were than the company's record year in two thousand eleven net orders that is after cancellations totalled eight hundred thirty-three a drop of forty-one percent
20130101_20130531_en_aaro-0004 are not expected to take part in combat operations although France's top diplomat hinted that may change

20130101_20130531_en_aarp-0014 I think if you were removed from outside that single market and have no influence on the conditions that apply there
20130101_20130531_en_aarp-0019 and in theory if you were to say OK you can revise membership for one country' then you might have a lot of
20130101_20130531_en_aarq-0004 what I like most without asking myself is this wearable or fit for the street and this the result this is what I was feeling
20130101_20130531_en_aarq-0005 won the designer for tomorrow in Berlin last year his latest work is inspired by angels
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0007 no it's a good thing and when it comes to flight safety the whole industry supports that so I hope above all that Boeing can fly the seven
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0010 you understand that the aviation industry is organised in a way that we agencies that verify the safety of our aircraft
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0013 despite your good results for twelve Boeing was well ahead of Airbus in terms of orders and
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0015 rival knocked you off the number one spot after several years what lessons can Airbus learn from that
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0016 the lesson is that in twelve we had a very good year which was better than expected with deliveries up ten percent
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0018 so you say we fell a long way behind Boeing we remain the market leader both in terms of the backlog of orders
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0020 seven aircraft on our books that's seven of production and that year after year we continued to increase our deliveries our speed of
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0026 if you look at Asia they are our fastest growing areas so we're not dependent on growth in one area such as Europe or the United States
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0027 indeed we are dependent on global growth and that growth is happening so I think we can on the figures I've announced and we won't see any surprises in
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0028 after you first came up the concept of the a three eighty you have only two hundred fifty-seven firm orders when do you expect to finally get over the problem of cracks appearing in the a three wings and for sales really off
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0029 firstly the problem of the micro found on aircraft in service in early twelve has been fixed
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0030 we found the cause we have come up with solutions and so hundred planes currently in service with airlines are being gradually retrofitted through to the end of fourteen
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0034 but eventually with the a three eighty we will take the lead because of congestion in the skies and with airports limited to the size they are they're going to need big planes like the a three
20130101_20130531_en_aarr-0038 and whether we're ahead of Boeing or behind them the market is growing five percent year so who's ahead really isn't that important
20130101_20130531_en_aars-0001 Airbus has lost its top spot to its US arch rival Boeing even though the European planemaker delivered record numbers of airliners last year but despite no longer being the number one is confident of improvements in both orders and this year as airlines look to replace their fleets with fuel efficient planes it delivered five hundred eighty-eight aircraft last year orders were a different story Airbus was able to
20130101_20130531_en_aars-0002 record net orders that is after cancellations totalled eight hundred thirty-three down forty-one percent far short of Boeing's
20130101_20130531_en_aars-0006 because of a potential fire risk from batteries it is not yet clear how much of a set back that will be for Boeing but analyst it could cost the
20130101_20130531_en_aars-0009 if they find something that needs to be recertified they will do that post production that's costly
20130101_20130531_en_aars-0012 a it remains confident the a three will achieve its maiden flight by the Middle of year

20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0001 the global economic outlook may be slightly improved but it's still a major headache for politicians and policymakers alike not least those on the front line like the International Monetary Fund so to discuss the perilous path ahead I am joined by the managing Director of the
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0004 there are two certainties in life death and taxes now I'd like to add another one and that's climate of uncertainty
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0005 is two thousand thirteen going to prove as uncertain as two thousand twelve
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0009 that policymakers will address the uncertainties and will try to remove them as much as they can in two thousand thirteen so that confidence can be restored
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0013 there's been a certain amount of back slapping here over Europe people congratulating themselves that Europe is back on the path to recovery it strikes me now the battle lines have been redrawn and
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0016 we've avoided the collapse in two thousand twelve we should guard against the relapse in two thousand thirteen and now is certainly not the time relax
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0020 the policymakers have to keep the momentum continue the reform continue sensible tax consolidations continue and complete the financial regulation
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0024 some may say put Europe in peril Britain in peril and for me it's symptomatic of European leaders putting their domestic agendas
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0029 the obstacles have arguments debates and eventually come out of it all together and stronger I really hope that's what happens in or out
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0031 and when it is striving and more competitive I think that's a debate that will be initiated as result of that
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0033 the Chancellor from Germany has indicated her determination to discuss competitiveness and as we know competitiveness is at the heart of many
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0035 to another issue accountability is very important you and the IMF was admirable in that it did admit mistakes in terms of its austerity measures to put it crudely
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0036 but mistakes have affected the lives millions of people in Greece for example should the IMF be held accountable
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0038 accountable just like anybody engaged in a public mission or in the private sector are all accountable and I think that the first measure of accountability to come up with the truth is to hide things behind the curtains or under the carpet
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0039 been a difficult decision but we have decided that we should be totally open to our membership and say you know as we constantly
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0040 we reassess we verify we check numbers our assumptions against the new reality now I submit that the new reality of
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0043 as we call them technically have indeed changed over time we want to recognise that to admit it
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0051 Greece had to consolidate Greece had to restructure Greece had to adjust its
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0053 the fiscal multiplier was higher than we had initially anticipated when the first programme was designed but it's not just on the basis of a fiscal multiplier that a programme is completed
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0054 the issue of Greece a few months back you caused some outcry when you said that you sympathise more
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0059 do not regret it I was returning from Africa and had in my mind and I still do today
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0060 children of Niger that I had who had teeny tiny little classrooms outside hardly any books and when the person me
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0063 and I added that it would be a good thing if all Greek people were paying their tax I still stand by that and clearly now endorsed by Greek authorities by the Greek
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0065 authorities and so on and so forth and there is a clear recognition that if the Greek authorities actually collect all taxes due including in particular from the wealthy Estates then the economy would be a lot better
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0075 deliver anywhere between seven and eight percent growth in two thousand thirteen it has now a new leadership team which has made it very clear that deliver on twelve th continual
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0078 China is clearly going to be one of the driving forces of global economy going forward so talk of a bubble is unfounded
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0080 they are likely to originate and particularly when it comes to real estate because I believe estate coupled with financial bubbles can be devastating as seen for the last five years but I would say that
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0085 is also overshadowing a greater problem the massive unemployment are we forgetting unemployment in the world when we look
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0089 are certainly significantly better and heading towards seven percent so that's an improvement but overall clearly unemployment is a major issue and the numbers that have been released by the
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0095 where everybody should really focus their attention making sure that growth will pick up because
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0099 speaking to the head of the ILO guy Ryder and he was saying what him was now we seem to be on path to recovery talking about the path to recovery but business people are forgetting about unemployment and he is worried that that is not to be tackled
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0103 because growth in and itself is not going to address the overall problem of balanced growth sustainable growth inclusive growth which we all recognise should be the attributes of growth and if you don't have jobs with growth forget about inclusiveness people excluded they don't participate in growth and therefore it's not sustainable so no I think jobs will remain at the centre of people's preoccupations make sure that is the case and
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0105 you see the unrest amongst the young people in world shaping out as we move into
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0106 number one it's double that of the general population and the general average and that's verified the world when you have a ten percent unemployment rate somewhere it's
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0111 and despair for not being able to enter the job market and that touches on the accountability principle that very keen about which I think will be
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0113 society is accountable to those young accountable to make sure that they are educated that they get the education that will give them access to the job market and that that growth is actually fueled
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0116 there's a lot of talk here at the for about global risks touched on quite a few here what other global risks do you identify
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0118 zones such as the United States if the big issues of the medium term debt reduction and deficits are not addressed properly you've got Japan if again the medium term debt
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0119 issue not addressed properly with identifiable solid anchorage you have the eurozone where construction and reconstruction and
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0125 clear effects on the stability of these economic zones you have a lot of territorial issues that often have to do with scarcity of resources
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0126 so all of those are risks that need to be addressed with goodwill and with cooperation I think what we most need going forward is cooperation
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0127 and policymakers wondering not just how they can fix their own domestic issues or how they rally support around national causes but
20130101_20130531_en_abbm-0128 what does it have outside and how can we get the best benefit out of

20130101_20130531_en_abrn-0039 exactly I can't speak ill of others on the contrary I want to be positive the other day in Russia
20130101_20130531_en_abrn-0040 me about a Zenit player I liked and I said the captain Denisov because he's really great player with a lot qualities is important for us
20130101_20130531_en_abrn-0041 the problem with Denisov and Kerzhakov was only a problem of money or some other Prejudice against you
20130101_20130531_en_abrn-0042 honestly I don't know I never talked with them about it I don't what they discussed with the clubs administration about me and I never read anything in the press about it for me not important we don't need be friends we need to respect other on pitch everyone has a life of their own
20130101_20130531_en_abrn-0043 during the match against Milan in the Champions League you were replaced before the end you didn't like it and you discussed it with the coach
20130101_20130531_en_abrn-0044 after the match you mentioned you might leave Zenit in January it didn't happen will leave in the summer
20130101_20130531_en_abrn-0047 in the coach and teammates don't think about that I feel more motivated to play for Zenit and will see on the
20130101_20130531_en_abrn-0050 fan Forum published a manifesto its website calling for a team without black or gay players I quote we are not racists but for us the lack of black players at Zenit is just an important tradition
20130101_20130531_en_abrn-0052 we are there play regardless of colour can be black White blue or yellow we are the same all flesh and
20130101_20130531_en_abrn-0054 the differences don't exist and this Prejudice shouldn't exist I must say I don't know
20130101_20130531_en_abrn-0055 only know the fans who back the team for ninety minutes they encourage me and my name so I have a positive view of Zenit fans and I have no problems

20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0033 it's the first time in Tunisia's history that a man has assassinated because of his political stance particularly since fall of the previous regime
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0034 the second consequence is that this assassination is going to deepen the atmosphere of frustration and division while the people have some very big political expectations
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0036 and those close to Belaid have accused the main party Ennahda in the ruling coalition of being behind this assassination
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0038 we say that the Tunisian government's great powerlessness lies in the perturbed and equivocal relationship at the heart of the movement between the leadership and representatives of a more radical and Salafist movement
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0041 this ambiguous relationship as well as the government's helplessness facilitated such an assassination
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0042 is what is happening today in Egypt and Tunisia the result of a failure of Islamist parties in power
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0043 the situation in Tunisia resembles enormously that in Egypt we observe this failure of governments and of political parties emanating from elections at the same time the other political parties not acted in a convincing enough manner to be able to succeed at the next elections
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0048 the events and particular circumstances are different but after October eighty-eight and the arrival of the Islamic Salvation front and other extremist groups assassinations of public figures multiplied just because they had said no to keeping people in the dark in that sense there is a resemblance Tunisia and Egypt
20130101_20130531_en_abrr-0049 but what is positive is that these two countries can learn lessons from what happened in Algeria in so as the Algerian government at the time closed its eyes to the abuses against civilians political parties and intellectuals
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0001 productivity is Italy's biggest problem and will be the next government's biggest challenge industrial production is down and labour productivity is not competitive which means manufacturing jobs are disappearing
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0002 so car giant has decided to go global on the one hand by merging with American auto maker Chrysler on the other by investing in innovation especially in its plants abroad
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0003 the company has recently invested one billion euros in factory to buy machinery needed to produce two new car models
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0004 says has no intention of closing down factories in Italy but at time the company recently announced a redundancy Fund over years the measures effectively mean less and drastic pay cuts the plant's five five hundred
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0005 while there is growing concern among the trade unions that many people could lose their jobs due to outsourcing these workers are trying to stay positive
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0006 their hopes investment of this kind help his keep up in a competitive and innovative environment
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0010 activities and now that decided to merge with Chrysler we hope will benefit from so far Americans have got most of the benefits but at Melfi we will make new Jeep models that's positive isn't it
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0013 it would be bad for us if Melfi were to shut down and go to China but if they decide to make cars both in China and in Melfi that's great
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0018 Aldo Caprarella earns hundred euros a month some of these say that they are ready to accept market reforms such as more flexibility in order to keep their jobs
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0024 the danger is that new production lines will dramatically the car making potential of our five five hundred workers and even the redundancy Fund agreement doesn't make it clear that all the workers will get their jobs back after a twenty-four month period
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0039 economies will be the only beneficiaries of the outsourcing of production lines from Italy
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0040 Serbia for instance they are making a model that could have been produced in Italy
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0044 has built a new innovative plant on the site of the Zastava factory best known its former Yugo cars
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0045 damaged in the ninety-nine NATO bombing Zastava was bought up by in two thousand eight the plant now produces the new five hundred for the global market

20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0055 plant they earn between three fifty and four hundred euros per month slightly above the average Serbian salary
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0056 the old Zastava plant employed twenty-five workers but there were no machines and salaries were slightly lower than today
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0057 since the end of the war and the transition from the embargoed Socialist system to a market economy Serbian productivity has grown dramatically but according to
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0059 in Italy industrial relations are more developed when it comes to job contracts and workers' here Serbia is going through a different phase
20130101_20130531_en_abrs-0061 and that there are no workers' rights it's just a different reality a different context so it is

20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0008 the vote doesn't bode well for a smooth transition rather a return to unstable governments that plagued Italy for decades

20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0018 many seems to be Grillo and that protest making it difficult to form a government
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0029 well they are and this vote the vote for Grillo is a kick in the pants for Italy's established parties one in four Italians voted for Beppe Grillo and his protest movement but unfortunately it solves nothing
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0031 over the coming weeks and that will hit Italy's rating and I fear will make the situation worse rather than better
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0036 not entirely unexpected have this situation structural reforms are never that popular
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0044 that say for EU policy because he was taking pro EU measures one in four people didn't vote that be indicative what they thought about the government before
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0057 why is such a reaction against well they were carrying out policy that many other countries in the European Union thought was good but also policy that the Italian parties themselves backed it was the stepping down of the Italian parties in recognition of their failure and putting in place of a technocratic government gave us some hope for the future of Italy but unfortunately those same parties or at least Mister Berlusconi's party decided to pull the plug on the whole thing just before Christmas and caused early elections how do you see that
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0058 I think what we're going to see now is that the markets are going to react badly we already seen
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0059 the reality that while Monti's reforms were not popular with the Italian people
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0079 down eventually by Berlusconi and Grill supporters I think a coalition
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0080 very difficult and very few people would trust Berlusconi particularly view of what he did in bringing down Mario government what I think
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0082 that Italian elected politicians recognising the need for a majority in both houses of parliament actually come together to form some new party some new alliance the
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0083 of taking Italy forward in the absence of that I think we'll have a period of drift increasing dissolution
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0087 part of the problem is that Berlusconi's character the kind of thing said
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0090 so I don't there is possibility for some of stable government to be formed without
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0102 any new government should be doing in Italy now I think if they want support of the financial markets which is be essential for investment
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0103 whatever government is formed has to give some commitment to carrying on with the tax reforms and the other structural reforms that Monti's government was pursuing
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0104 it's hard to see how will get those policies through government because even if there's a majority the chamber there's unlikely to be a majority in the upper house and Berlusconi is going to hold all the cards
20130101_20130531_en_acnv-0127 I think the exact timing isn't clear but there will be new elections and we have to have a resolution
20130101_20130531_en_acnw-0001 leaders of non Christian faiths in Italy have been giving their reactions to Benedict's departure and looking to a new era despite angering many Muslims during his reign the last also made conciliatory gestures and some say inspired more intense dialogue between the two religions
20130101_20130531_en_acnw-0003 I think that our hope is to see communities of believers search together for solutions to the world's problems
20130101_20130531_en_acnw-0005 and above all to find common ground on which to work and in particular find universal values to which all believers can relate

20130101_20130531_en_adhb-0004 the problem is not agriculture whatever the size the problem is subsidies are distributed around farmers and not necessarily the farmers themselves

20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0002 the government says it was left with no choice and that the alternative was a losing Proposition now small account holders as well as large are dreading the pinch where it hurts most their wallets as currently stand Cyprus is waiting for ten billion euros in aid from the EU and the International Monetary Fund one of conditions is accounts than hundred euros be taxed at a rate of six
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0003 percent and above that at a rate of nine nine percent the island asked for seventeen billion euros which was cut back

20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0007 for the first time in a bailout bank depositors are having contribute has the European Union broken a taboo
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0008 I think you have to remember that the European had adopted a very clear principle of protecting people's
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0010 that clear principle set after the two thousand eight financial crisis in order to prevent contagion the collapse of Lehman brothers
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0013 the risk of contagion is limited because not talking about a big event but anyway the authorities must clearly state the principle that was
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0015 don't forget that this is a key principle of the EU banking union that is being set up so that's another reason to stick to this principle of protecting bank savings of Europe's small account holders
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0016 however Cyprus accounts for just two percent of Europe's GDP not much they are being lent ten billion euros is this not a sign that the eurozone countries and especially Germany are Fed just giving money and they want the countries concerned take some responsibility
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0018 but said that the loan must be provided under conditions that make Cyprus responsible as well there has to be an effort by the country
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0019 are we going to ask Cyprus's small investors to contribute and the big savers in Cyprus
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0024 exactly you mention Russian assets maybe fifteen to twenty billion euros perhaps dirty money
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0026 yes I think this bailout loan process in Cyprus should be used to make the Cypriot banks more
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0027 because in my opinion it is not good to use euro area banks for Russian investors' financial transactions that are clear so must clarify that I
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0031 is there a risk of uncertainty returning to the markets after they have been stable for several weeks
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0033 I'll say again we're facing a small economic and financial problem but we have to pay attention the psychological effects around this sensitive area that is protecting small savers' money
20130101_20130531_en_adhh-0034 and therefore in my opinion a very clear message has to be sent as soon as possible by the European institutions starting with the European Central Bank
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0004 such as miracle cures for example others are hidden in places expect to find them in loans or between the lines of too good to be true promotions we
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0005 when I bought my computer nobody told that all consumer goods bought in Europe have an automatic two year guarantee
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0007 the directive return up to two years after purchase instead client a so called extended warranty that fact overlapped the free statutory two year warranty
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0012 I thought that what they told me was true so I signed and ended up paying much more than necessary I feel they've made a fool of me I feel duped and cheated
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0021 according the European directive there are two main categories of unfair commercial practices aggressive and misleading the latter be it through action omission pushes the average to take decisions he would not have taken misleading advertising is one example
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0030 the problem is that it was broadcast over a two year period and people believed it it's been censored but nobody reported that it wasn't in the papers or in other media so the advert worked
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0032 unfair commercial practices are everywhere and involve companies one wouldn't suspect Italian car giant for example was fined for promising motorists they would save lot of money on fuel if
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0033 car even Italy's government run train operator Trenitalia was sanctioned after it promoted euros tickets that were virtually impossible to get hold of
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0037 a typical example is telecommunication companies phone companies have been handed at least one fines they don't play fair and they don't change their ways
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0039 misleading advertising only a drop in the Ocean of unfair practices door to door selling for example can easily turn into aggressive practice
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0044 member states deplore a lack of resources the complexity of internal procedures and the absence of sanctions
20130101_20130531_en_adhi-0049 the goal now is to harmonise its implementation in order to make sure that what you pay for is what you get

20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0007 if you like this budgetary pact refers to the lack of a political Europe
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0008 and it raises the question of what is happening with this integration process where democracy is being reduced within each member state without increasing democracy at the Federal level
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0021 was the factor after the of the single European currency balanced budgets and public debt are the factors
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0022 exactly you said that national debts are sovereign but the euro is a currency without a country without a political union is the banking union been agreed is enough
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0024 firstly it's not exactly right when I say that debts are sovereign but there's no sovereign currency
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0025 the problem is that the European countries are running up debt in a currency over which they have no control
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0034 when the exchange for individual currencies disappeared it was no longer possible to speculate in those European currencies
20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0035 now we have to create single equity or security for debt that way it would not be possible for investors to speculate on European sovereign debt

20130101_20130531_en_adjv-0057 one lesson that can be drawn from the recent past is that the European Union as it is now is not working it's not one thing or the other if we solve this problem and move towards political union does that mean we'll have to give up on the whole European Project'

20130101_20130531_en_adpo-0031 evident that this route and these countries were not chosen by chance by the new Chinese leader for his first overseas trip
20130101_20130531_en_adpo-0032 his route very clearly tells us about the priorities of modern China and the new
20130101_20130531_en_adpo-0035 and in the view of the new Chinese authorities Russia is moving into the position forming a very close and intimate alliance
20130101_20130531_en_adpo-0036 Africa question is different it's not a secret that Africa now is one of the main targets in field of Chinese economic interests

20130101_20130531_en_adpo-0069 it looks like the main aim of the military operation is to force China out from the south of the Sahara indeed Africa is becoming battlefield in a very tense struggle
20130101_20130531_en_adpo-0071 like France or the USA which has no colonial history but does have huge interest in Africa of course none of them are going to accept Africa becoming the source of mineral resources China's growth

20130101_20130531_en_adsd-0026 accept China's initiative to return to the six way negotiating table for denuclearising the peninsula but here we can really say it has ratcheted up the tension partly it's because there's a new leader and all the leaders in region
20130101_20130531_en_adsd-0027 there's a new team in China a new president in South Korea and new prime minister in Japan so it's important for

20130101_20130531_en_adti-0001 am Chris Burns and welcome to I talk some call strip mining of the seas over fishing that is wiping out fish stocks sometimes to the point of near extinction and what about the safety and quality of the fish we eat
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0005 a whole show that what is your prognosis positive negative of the economic situation we can be slightly
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0012 I am still optimistic why because we can a slight light now at the end of the tunnel for the first time Greece has a surplus and are some reforms ongoing and we are expecting

20130101_20130531_en_adti-0049 this what we call maximum sustainability so I can say that if our reform will be in place then we can have a very good prognosis because after
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0051 almost all stocks are going to be fished in a sustainable way and this means that
20130101_20130531_en_adti-0053 more jobs in the Fisheries sector and we can have also twenty-four additional income twenty-four percent for our fishermen that's another danger with overfishing

20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0010 Cahuzac took libel action against Mediapart and he swore up and down it wasn't true he lied brazenly on camera on radio parliament in flagrante
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0012 I deny categorically the allegations on the Mediapart I have never ever had an account abroad
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0013 but police analysis of the voice in the recording stacked the case against him and when Cahuzac was placed under investigation the budget minister's fall was only a matter of time
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0015 cardiologist who had become a plastic before he became a politician and was appointed to lead
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0022 firstly what you think about the four months of lying by the former budget minister and his adamant denials publicly playing at offended and outraged
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0029 and what has happened is quite rigorously just the opposite so this political crisis is just getting started
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0031 he was the budget minister someone who is supposed to set an example to fight tax fraud
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0035 how to explain to the French people they have to make sacrifices when the height of state power these words are not being respected
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0036 political error goes down badly especially when ordinary people are having a difficult time but the lying has been seen as even worse the French showed this in their reactions this morning
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0039 and here they have the proof a minister confessing which is quite exceptional
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0045 can the do first can take offence explain that an individual was responsible that Prime Minister Ayrault didn't know that the president didn't know
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0046 that doesn't mean the president safe he didn't know what was going on thought Cahuzac was not guilty
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0047 the government's authority could suffer since it was already in grave danger in opinion polls
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0048 beyond case and this government investigations scandals been multiplying in political circles there's a feeling that everyone is
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0050 the French are demanding the truth yes but I think in way that stopped believing and the most serious thing of all we are in a political crisis which has gone so far as to become a moral crisis of democracy itself
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0051 I was going to ask you this discrediting of the political class is it good democracy
20130101_20130531_en_adzn-0052 no obviously it can't be for democracy if the Cahuzac case affects the left today the right is equally affected by other scandals and build up of all of them risks going in favour of those who say that the whole political class is corrupt and we have try something different

20130101_20130531_en_aefa-0007 our objective was to develop a modular scalable platform able to respond to four big
20130101_20130531_en_aefa-0009 is used inside sport facilities to answer those questions we have developed four independent modules designed to monitor control and optimise the

20130101_20130531_en_aefa-0012 sports centre near Rome was used as pilot site to test the platform it has a network of sensors around indoor swimming pool to
20130101_20130531_en_aefa-0013 the energy used for lighting heating cooling air quality and ventilation and the
20130101_20130531_en_aefa-0016 have for instance us understand that there is a huge temperature variation due to the position of the swimming pool and its ventilation system there is around seven degrees Celsius difference between the north and the south facing sides so in space there is a huge variation in thermo hydrometric conditions these optimised sensors allow us to calculate that variation in an accurate affordable way
20130101_20130531_en_aefa-0017 data from the swimming pool and other sports areas was then sent to a central module to be analysed after checking complimentary data like weather forecasting or planned facility usage it can optimise energy consumption
20130101_20130531_en_aefa-0019 sensors allow us to measure the energy consumption in the gym the swimming pool the dressing rooms the administration office all the different spaces inside this facility

20130101_20130531_en_aefa-0023 researchers think that once fully developed platform will allow sport facilities like this one to save up to thirty percent of their energy bills after just five years which is good news for sports facility owners

20130101_20130531_en_aeme-0003 the presidential election this Sunday in Venezuela is expected to give country either a leader who tries to fill the shoes of the late Hugo Chavez or a leader with new shoes Nicolas Maduro was Chavez's right man and to carry on like his powerful friend
20130101_20130531_en_aeme-0004 the opposition United behind him would like to draw a line under the Chavez version of socialism Maduro did Chavez's bidding
20130101_20130531_en_aeme-0006 Chavez built a foundation of adoring voters Maduro is following in his footsteps but with no guarantee he can keep up the pace either political or theatrical

20130101_20130531_en_aeme-0027 there be a surprise because as you say all the polls show the vote going to Nicolas Maduro it's possible he'll get a lower percentage than President Chavez did last October when he won with
20130101_20130531_en_aeme-0030 that we are that it can go on and will go on even if the country is divided into two or even three blocks because a lot of Venezuelans do not support Chavismo's projects or support the opposition and that is where the struggle to win votes will concentrate
20130101_20130531_en_aeme-0031 I believe Chavismo has momentum without Chavez because become a religious figure and named Maduro as his presidential successor before leaving for Cuba

20130101_20130531_en_aeme-0047 there are economic interests and even though there have been some tensions in the past with Hugo Chavez relations flow quite well
20130101_20130531_en_aeme-0048 from the EU's side there hasn't been any criticism of the drift towards authoritarianism during Hugo Chavez's time the relationship is different than is between Venezuela and the United States

20130101_20130531_en_aent-0001 North Korea has raised political and military tensions on the last weeks with serious threats directed at its enemies South Korea Japan and the United States it started on February with an underground nuclear test that prompted sanctions by the UN security Council from there to a
20130101_20130531_en_aent-0002 was just a step it is estimated that North Korea has nearly ten nuclear warheads substantially less than Russia's eight five hundred or the
20130101_20130531_en_aent-0005 two missile with a range of six kilometres or the untested three with an estimated capacity of ten
20130101_20130531_en_aent-0011 who feels that North Korea is going to launch any sort of military attack what they may do is test launch a missile
20130101_20130531_en_aent-0014 because never been tested and to do this around the birthday of founder Kim Il sung if it fails would be a great embarrassment but North Korea has kept everyone guessing and it is predictably unpredictable so no can actually predict what will happen but the chances of war seem extremely
20130101_20130531_en_aent-0018 grandson of founder Kim Il sung is in charge in Korean history bloodline is extremely important that was the case with Kings through the centuries and
20130101_20130531_en_aent-0019 little doubt it seems even though he is very young and the sort of things we are hearing about him that is too young he is inexperienced is
20130101_20130531_en_aent-0020 he is diabolical we heard these things his father Kim Il came power and there lots of predictions of the imminent collapse
20130101_20130531_en_aent-0023 behind this crisis and that the main target is Japan due to interests on some disputed
20130101_20130531_en_aent-0024 Islands would you agree that China is somehow manipulating that that
20130101_20130531_en_aent-0025 interesting theory which I don't many people would subscribe to what this seems directed
20130101_20130531_en_aent-0027 negotiations and recognition from Washington it definitely wants to be taken seriously and it would like to have aid whether that aid is coming from Washington or Seoul and by committing

20130101_20130531_en_aenu-0002 following the strongly contested presidential election in which the candidate of the official upper hand won Nicolas Maduro versus the opposition candidate Capriles but only by a one and a half percent margin surveys had predicted a far clearer victory for Maduro Venezuelans' divisions stark and with this so does uncertainty surrounding what's to come
20130101_20130531_en_aenu-0012 more than six hundred thirty votes swung to the candidate of the opposition this is unknown in our history of electoral procedures and we have had many
20130101_20130531_en_aenu-0014 this result puts the country at a crossroads for dialogue because the country must get together faced with two comparable forces there is no alternative without losing the great wealth that
20130101_20130531_en_aenu-0017 has denounced what he says are irregularities on the day of voting and rejected the results demanding complete recount of the ballots by hand is there a realistic possibility to appeal through the electoral tribunal and get a
20130101_20130531_en_aenu-0020 there's the information from the whole country to do it all the votes and we have the technical resources to verify the result
20130101_20130531_en_aenu-0021 this doesn't seem worrying to me I believe if the results have been tampered with then we need to correct
20130101_20130531_en_aenu-0022 not necessarily because one side or the other interfered but because they weren't correctly counted
20130101_20130531_en_aenu-0025 not a problem of being willing or not a question of applying written laws and rules and the electoral statutes
20130101_20130531_en_aenu-0026 reviewing the electoral process is so normal that in the past both candidates have accepted it the candidate of the opposition asked for it and the incumbent who was favoured to win according to the result accepted
20130101_20130531_en_aenu-0027 I imagine that seems strange if one is familiar with the electoral process in Venezuela going over the process here is not a rare thing
20130101_20130531_en_aenu-0032 I believe that we are facing a very close result and that for the good health and political future of Venezuela
20130101_20130531_en_aenu-0034 the mechanism to do that as I said is institutionalised legal and not of the ordinary it's true that it doesn't happen very often what usually happens is what did on seven October when he conceded that Chavez had won by a comfortable margin this time there were special interventions' in several voting stations there were cases where people were prevented from voting there were complaints of a of impartiality by members of the armed forces which could alter the result
20130101_20130531_en_aenu-0035 campaigning and the closeness of the result how deeply Venezuelans are divided how do you see the future is a reconciliation possible and necessary

20130101_20130531_en_aenv-0052 money that's available and the services needed and what we need to do is work together ensure that we're looking at what the evidence is us at where the need

20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0006 the economic crisis is affecting international art market like all sectors in a relative or differentiated way because art market has special characteristics
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0007 this market is surprising a market where there are only individuals individual collectors and individual objects
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0008 very special characteristics and therefore faced with a crisis we that masterpieces rare works with a prestigious provenance paintings are not affected by the
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0010 in contrast objects of lesser value interesting paintings but of less marked value can be affected by the crisis and their estimates should at this point extremely precise to enable us to sell them
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0012 there have been some auctions where works reach incredible prices is art always a good investment or is the risk of a bubble effect
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0013 true that the major auctions have been breaking records last year for example Sotheby's in New York sold a of Eduard Munch the Scream' famous work for more than one hundred twenty million
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0014 works of Picasso sold at auction in Paris for example a portrait of Dora Maar went for seven million euros
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0015 true that these figures suggest that the art market is a somewhat protected area a safe haven in times
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0016 the reality is more nuanced of course because again there are areas where there fewer buyers and worries about the global economic situation may be

20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0021 some other sectors have experienced in recent years a very rapid development such as the of Africa and
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0023 another area that seen a dramatic development is Asian art only a dozen years ago the art market was a reserved primarily for Western clients Europeans and Americans
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0024 in recent Asian buyers including the Chinese came to the market a huge appetite for buying works of their history imperial works seals jades and ceramics
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0027 the identity of the buyers the profile of the buyers in the art market has evolved in recent years a dozen years ago the typical profile of the collector was a Western one a European an American
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0028 today the typical profile is difficult to say because there are buyers from Russia China India and America who have increased the number of potential customers on top of the Americans and Europeans who still there
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0030 in addition secondary sectors have highly developed in recent years take for example photography or the art of Africa
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0033 of new buyers younger a different from what we had in the more traditional sectors ten years ago

20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0038 and then there were extremely important auction houses and dealers that dominated the world at a time when the art market was still relatively small
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0039 it was a coexistence of national markets and throughout the eighties nineties and since two thousand the market became international
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0045 the action moved to countries and sales places that are dynamic to attract buyers and create large events around sales
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0051 objects that are sold on the art market as well the collectors involved in the art market are mobile
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0052 an object can be sold in Paris but its owner can also decide to sell it very easily in London or Geneva
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0053 a collector can choose to buy at an auction in Paris but can also buy in London Geneva or New York today with international technology the internet sending catalogues communications made by auction houses
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0059 we had like other sectors a crisis in two thousand eight two thousand nine crisis of confidence and so the market shrank we rebounded strongly developed well in ten eleven
20130101_20130531_en_aesr-0061 was a little down and thirteen watching carefully because I think there are risk factors we must be cautious in estimating the that are on sale because the horizon of all the economic operators but also our customers is under scrutiny people are not making long term plans they see that this year is undeniably difficult at a European level so they are cautious our role this context is to adapt ourselves by making extremely attractive estimations to generate trust

20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0006 Italy is still in a political impasse months after it held legislative elections
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0007 its institutional stalemate is the product of the seemingly unsolvable puzzle of the February ballot
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0008 the centre left led by Pier Luigi Bersani got an absolute majority in lower house of parliament but not in the Senate three blocs there neutralised other the

20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0024 it was impossible eighty-seven year old Giorgio Napolitano nearing the end of his term as President of the Republic to call fresh elections to try to unblock the logjam and so Italy was in an institutional paralysis as it sank further into the economic mud
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0025 in a joint session of the chamber of deputies and the Senate along with special regional electors it took six rounds of voting for the political blocs to produce a
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0026 which was to keep Napolitano on for an unprecedented second term Bersani tendered his resignation paving way for a leadership battle
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0029 Grillo calling for protest said the traditional parties he blames for Italy's economic decline and corruption have already agreed to form a broad coalition to the status quo
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0032 Napolitano has accepted the invitation of the country's two main political coalitions to serve again for a new term
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0033 in return however Napolitano has asked the parties to hold themselves accountable Italians are wondering how these politicians can possibly keep such a promise given that in recent months the image they have presented has been so bad
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0036 I think they allow the new government at least one year in which to do several much needed things
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0044 you've mentioned Europe in your opinion what kind of message is Italy sending the EU by re instating Napolitano
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0045 the message is remember we have an excellent President of the Republic with a high international standing a man you can
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0047 who represents very well a country that has a lot of problems to solve here he is please your
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0049 at moment the favourite as Prime Minister seems to be Giuliano Amato do you think that Amato in the coming months will be able to carry out both the institutional and
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0051 Giuliano Amato is very appreciated by the President and I'm sure that Napolitano will give him the full support of his
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0053 Amato has an international profile he is fluent in English and he is a Treasury minister
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0057 the president's backing and a of responsibility from the different parties Amato will be able move ahead with those reforms that have been outlined already and which need to be completed in no more a year
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0058 otherwise we risk huge delay a failure to fulfil commitments and that could accentuate speculation against Italy by the markets
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0060 if very Soon' means within three to six months I'd say no I think we should give the government one year's time
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0061 government in any country even in the most efficient democracies can carry long term projects if it allowed survive for less than a year the problem is we need to rebuild our country
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0063 but in that time we can make progress on some of the guidelines which are already there which have been wisely outlined for Italy by the European Commission
20130101_20130531_en_aeuy-0064 we can pull ourselves together this can be done all the rest will depend obviously on the approval the government manages to earn and its ability to accomplish tasks but also on the backing the different parties will to grant Amato

20130101_20130531_en_aeuz-0009 about the European market's continued decline in March Peugeot Citroen sales fell sixteen percent year on year what are you doing to halt that seemingly never ending decline
20130101_20130531_en_aeuz-0010 the European Automobile market is down by twenty five percent between two thousand seven and twelve that represents four million fewer cars being bought by customers in Europe and we really see no signs that us hope of a rebound
20130101_20130531_en_aeuz-0011 this year we think the market will drop by around five percent and see no signs of a rebound this year or next year including in Germany
20130101_20130531_en_aeuz-0012 do those poor sales figures for March in Europe mean that Peugeot will have to consider more job losses at its plants on top of those that have already been announced
20130101_20130531_en_aeuz-0013 it's obvious that unfortunately because of the major recession in Europe having to restructure the company in Europe it's very difficult to take these huge decisions and we try to do that in the most
20130101_20130531_en_aeuz-0014 way possible when it comes to issues having made a commitment that we will help every single one of our workers facing problems with employment
20130101_20130531_en_aeuz-0015 working on a two year timetable get the PSA group back into profit that is by the end of fourteen even so it's always a very difficult decision to have to cut jobs but unfortunately it is the market

20130101_20130531_en_aexn-0034 they continued to sell those products and the management gave orders that they should presented as if they were long term deposits that could be easily cashed in

20130101_20130531_en_aexn-0037 those preferred shares were sold at too high a price could those sales be annuled and what consequences would that have for Spain's bank restructuring

20130101_20130531_en_aexn-0046 it's clearly enough I guess the government feels guilty and Brussels wasn't told about the criminal way these toxic products were sold I suppose that the government's conscience was pricked was the only reason it is giving back a little bit of money otherwise its behavior is incomprehensible
20130101_20130531_en_aexn-0047 the government knows that eventually the evidence presented to the court will mean all the purchase contracts will have to be cancelled and all money returned

20130101_20130531_en_afct-0018 for example they have had to register the births of two of their three children and sign up for social security
20130101_20130531_en_afct-0020 every time we do official paperwork we're not sure if we're doing everything within our rights because we're foreigners when actually of course we have the same rights
20130101_20130531_en_afct-0022 also we have the impression that we're a nuisance either because of the queue behind us or because the kids are noisy or because we're not the only ones filling in papers and we take more time the officials in front of us
20130101_20130531_en_afct-0023 so we up saying damn we have annoyed them we have been a real nuisance' at the of the day they're not there for us normally they're there to help Austrian people

20130101_20130531_en_afct-0042 but Brussels says the regulation will not force countries to recognise a document's contents which some had been calling for

20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0001 bees to horse meat to ageing populations an eclectic mix of issues yet all in one man's portfolio and to top it all a smattering of controversy and scandal it's certainly been a busy six months in office
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0003 this week is Mister Tonio Borg who is the EU Commissioner for health and consumer policy many thanks for joining us
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0006 from East Flanders I like to know what the European Union is doing prevent horse meat from being sold as
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0007 you have just presented a new set of EU food safety proposals but to wait two thousand sixteen until they are adopted into law possibly what happens in the meantime of all horse meat scandal was a safety issue
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0013 we already have dissuasive and appropriate punishment applied by member states we are going to increase the
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0015 legislating to the effect that the pecuniary penalty to be equal to the economic gain made out of the violation of
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0016 and then be other inspections unannounced and also the Commission will be able to oblige member states to do the testing I must say testing DNA was done by all member states beyond the number suggested I guess that you must be expecting something like to happen again possibly in the near future because this is the result of an economic crisis where suppliers are squeezed financially to provide cheaper and cheaper
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0020 he or she is caught and that that person is judged by the state courts in the member states I must say that the entire scandal was discovered through enforcement by a member state in this case
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0022 rat meat is being sold as lamb now given that we've got a confusion in our food chain here in Europe can you be sure that we're not being sold Chinese meat here
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0023 conduct inspections outside the European Union so that importation of food products from outside the
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0024 to come from certain approved sites sometimes even approved regions so this is the
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0029 can I mean even three Summers ago there was the importation of vegetables from outside the
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0034 everything can happen but I think we have one of the best food safety systems in the world and one of the best labelling
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0038 hello name is I'm from Latvia my question is how can ensure the new
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0041 this isn't actually a ban yet it's a suspension I think for two years but how monitor this it's
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0042 there was resistance against this ban but there was an absolute majority in favour there the qualified majority in favour neither against in which case the Commission proceeds with ban and that is law so it will be
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0045 fighting a very powerful lobby the pesticide lobby and been arguing that over the course of five years if this ban were to go to years this the economy like
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0046 seventeen billion euros something like fifty jobs what do you say to that I must say that
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0048 the ban the ban itself and these economic apocalyptic consequences did not result so we have to protect our bees because bees are doing this pollination
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0064 this is a good question isn't it because in less than years it's estimated that a third of European
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0067 in these times of economic crisis there will be cuts budgets as I mean this will be normal so rather than whining about these cuts one has to
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0073 partnership on healthy ageing which we promote the European Commission but also have to discover new means of cutting costs and retaining
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0075 it would be something very if all member states would indulge in this
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0080 monitored your health situation is monitored from the centre and you remain at home would be beneficial
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0081 for those who have reached a certain age rather than going to clinics and covering these distances would be
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0089 we had in the multi annual financial programme but you accept that now in this period of economic people aren't really able to afford healthcare and we possibly see a
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0097 now not only in our economies but also in our health systems then we are inviting
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0102 very strong in the health sector so actually coordinate
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0107 the troika has actually slashed spending on health in Greece and Portugal yes as well which does not mean slashing directly
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0111 slightly off topic you were elected Commissioner there was some controversy over your personal views particularly same sex
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0112 divorce what you say to your detractors who said that your personal values would affect policy
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0114 certain respects as regards animal welfare as regards other issues as well and I have respected the principle of subsidiarity that is to say in most matters which you have mentioned are the
20130101_20130531_en_afpb-0115 member states and not of the Commission and your personal values will not influence policy making values are my personal values they are important in the same way other commissioners have their personal values but we here as commissioners and we apply EU

20130101_20130531_en_afpe-0016 and perhaps now this is turning back because people did not vote for a conventional pop song for Eurovision but for a song that means a lot many people

20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0005 it's been a momentous at Manchester United with Sir Alex Ferguson finally deciding to retire and we know his successor will be David Moyes from Everton now Sir Alex was in a League of his own having stayed at the helm for nearly twenty-seven years so how a task is David Moyes facing to talk to about those issues now is Joe Allen from our sports Joe
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0006 what we expect from David Moyes it is a tough challenge for anybody it tough challenge
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0011 that is required to manage this team well and I think that's been helped by
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0012 Sir Alex Ferguson of course with the legacies he's left behind the footballing philosophies
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0017 there's that never say die attitude that most clubs fear about United whether you're losing two nil with five minutes remaining
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0022 it's been drilled into the players from a very early age so I think Moyes
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0025 cut from the same cloth they're both Scottish they both share similar backgrounds but how unusual is it to give manager a six year contract worth a reputed thirty-five euros well

20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0047 without a doubt new pressure be facing not only with dealing with a dressing room full of stars but also there's going be pressure from the top and I'm thinking Sir Alex Ferguson
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0054 the inner workings of old Trafford and the ethics of it all and I don't think go to
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0064 does need the advice he will go and seek it from Ferguson I don't think shy away from that
20130101_20130531_en_afrq-0073 and I think again that legacy that Ferguson has left behind no man is bigger than the club I think Moyes will carry that

20130101_20130531_en_agcb-0021 now there is always little more luck compared to other sectors of the economy they're more affected
20130101_20130531_en_agcb-0022 we also think going to the movies also costs fortunately we can go into a cinema and not pay very much this is not the most expensive hobby and get a

20130101_20130531_en_agev-0009 Rafsanjani registering as a candidate at the last minute upset many political factions and ruined their plans
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0012 triggered spontaneous protests and violent repression severely damaging the ruling system's credentials
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0016 this should be our sacred objective not necessary in the current circumstances keep some people in prison for alleged activities they should be allowed to rejoin their families
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0017 Rafsanjani was speaker of Parliament for nine years from eighty-nine ninety-seven he was President of Iran alongside Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0020 it was his biggest defeat this time supporters hoped he'd come back to save the and to stop the downward slide in relations with the US the EU and powerful countries but the clerics have had a turbulent eight years with Ahmadinejad they want a president who will go along with them

20130101_20130531_en_agev-0024 to general surprise Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani was disqualified even though he the head of the supervisory Expediency Council and a former president
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0025 Rafsanjani has had a very important role in the formation of the Islamic Republic yet in spite of this was disqualified how you see
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0027 on the one hand Rafsanjani's disqualification is in fact a disqualification of the Islamic revolution in which he had a substantial role
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0028 at least until his second term as president he was one of the top decision makers of the regime
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0029 after that he has held posts as head of the Expediency Council and head of the House of experts and these are very important posts in the Islamic Republic
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0030 on the other hand in fact he has disqualified the order of Supreme leader Khamenei which seems in probability to be the case it can be said that
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0036 some social and political personalities including daughter Ayatollah Khomeini the founder of the Islamic Republic have asked the leader to intervene and a state to bring Rafsanjani into the elections probable do you think that is
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0047 the credentials of Esfandiar Rahim Mashaie protege of Ahmedinejad have also been rejected how predictable was that
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0051 with Mashaie and their supporters would rouse some sort of reactions in society
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0053 those concerns may still be there as far as we know the Guardian Council has decided firmly it is a risk worth taking
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0054 we will within the next few whether or not this is Khamenei's decision it seems very probable that he has decided to disqualify Mashaie
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0056 that he not have to go through the headache of the next two presidential terms Mashaie
20130101_20130531_en_agev-0058 of course I think that whichever presidential candidate comes to power will still have the same with the leader as

20130101_20130531_en_agga-0005 have to look to a future where cheap labour costs are no a draw for foreign manufacturers China is very challenged demographically we are seeing a shortage of labour for manufacturing and companies like Foxconn Honhai

20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0015 not really a choice but an obligation because I'd say generous donors are no longer to be found
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0018 and it seems to me that sound management is the best way to lay the groundwork for future growth and job creation in future
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0019 we get impression that on the chess board Europe seems to stand alone with its obsession for public accounts
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0023 over whether the first thing to do is to place the stress on putting the public finances into working order
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0034 but it has distanced the risk of catastrophe thanks to the decisions it has taken governments the European institutions and the Central Bank
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0035 therefore we are now at a stage where we absolutely must consolidate everything which might permit a return to growth
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0036 what lesson can we from the Greek or Cypriot crisis perhaps some economies were too feeble to be into the euro zone or are the stronger euro zone economies not ready to pay a high cost to protect the poorer members
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0040 fortunately relatively numerous that are competitive that sell their goods and services comfortably on the domestic European and world markets
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0041 and have good reasons for that because they have a good grip on their costs and structural
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0043 and then there are countries that have mastered their costs far less well and which have not reformed structurally
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0045 so I believe that the great lesson is that there has to be a staggering improvement in the economic and budgetary governance
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0047 it has to be very firm when this or that becomes dangerous to itself and to the entire zone
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0068 I believe that works it hasn't worked in the past and I don't think it will in the future
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0069 instead what I myself as realistically imaginable is instead of fines
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0074 and the European Parliament with its members elected by direct universal suffrage
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0081 then the European Parliament decides evidently limited to representatives of the euro zone and after contact with the national parliaments
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0083 but they respect the principle of subsidiarity because this is not applied generally it would only be in absolutely exceptional cases and when the stability of the whole is in question
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0085 the ultimate decision is taken by representatives of the people and that makes it relatively certain that these are not just empty words
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0087 is an alignment being formed in Europe notably with France Italy and Spain who are adopting an approach of reasoning by dialogue with the policy German Chancellor Angela Merkel
20130101_20130531_en_aggb-0096 that it has dealt with and responded to a way that is indisputable when we look at everything that has been done at this terribly difficult time
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0003 at a Bangladesh clothing factory to ensure such a disaster does not happen again
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0004 global union brings together nine hundred unions representing fifteen million workers worldwide has been pushing for
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0006 consumers are asking for cheaper and cheaper goods we've already seen another factory collapse in Cambodia do you think you can ensure such a disaster doesn't happen again
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0015 we have more than forty of the major retail global brands signed up to legally binding agreement this matters this is different and this is going to have an impact
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0016 all those European consumers even in the midst of a recession even at a time of squeeze are you prepared to pay penny or
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0019 children and of mothers working in factory conditions would be unacceptable to every single European Union citizen we've had enough they've had enough and that's why this agreement is in place to
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0022 why you get retailers to sign up to an agreement in all the countries they operate in
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0023 one of the issues going to have to discuss is how do we this a broader based agreement but given the factory collapse
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0025 more than two lives have been lost in Bangladesh given that in Bangladesh this is a sector employing four million people in four factories that was the critical issue but help is coming and help is on the way for all of those other countries I think it is inevitable that we broaden discussion
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0027 name is Nicolas and I am French which big companies haven't yet signed up to the accord for Bangladesh
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0032 is in the United States of America we do have Abercrombie Fitch we have Calvin Klein we Tommy
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0036 supermarket chain is Walmart they employ two million people they are the supply chain experts they know how to
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0037 every grain out of the supply chain to reduce costs they've refused said they do their own thing
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0038 be their own judge and jury they are the new flag of convenience to themselves in this process and
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0040 likes to present itself trendy contemporary responsible I know going on in gap
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0042 for a side agreement just for them and we've simply refused the US National retail federation has said that the agreement you have worked upon lacks and I quote here common sense' is particularly problematic for the US what do you say to that
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0051 and they are saying this lacks common sense we are talking about life and death here the common sense is about doing what we can together private and union with government to improve the quality of life for the Bangladeshis that's common sense but it's also the common good if you are talking about life and death then it could argued that you've been quite intransigent in the negotiation process wouldn't it have been better to get a bit of a broader coalition retailers on board and
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0059 you or your listeners or viewers get the impression that this is somehow a marginal event that it have a critical mass that
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0064 are not properly enforceable where there is no transparency all we get vague promises yes things will improve
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0074 the European Union making a wishy washy statement about we must do more to implement improve labour standards in Bangladesh is not enough
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0077 the social Affairs Commissioner should say we support this agreement we support the business community and Industri all
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0078 global union to ensure this applied the European Union has to stop the race to the bottom
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0080 of this race to the bottom where basically these Bangladeshi workers are surviving on thirty-eight dollars a
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0082 all I can do and the ETUC the European trade Union movement will use their best persuasive powers to ensure that this will happen in practice and the European Union could put more
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0085 private sector employer in Europe that the goods that they sell are being produced in fair
20130101_20130531_en_aggc-0088 that this at the end of the day is making the world of turn turn for business but at the end of the day for the people who are toiling in intolerable conditions that they will get a better life

20130101_20130531_en_agge-0003 every day four hundred kilometres above our heads astronauts living in space
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0006 the frontier outpost of human exploration and with spacewalks and dockings contend with the responsibility is
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0009 the time would for the ground to send a command to that machine in case something goes wrong would be too late
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0014 is the European astronaut centre all astronauts heading to the ISS have to train
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0027 it's too fast and not too slow should something go wrong I am the last line of defence and I can send a command to stop
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0030 and then watched as they work if a European is in space there is always someone in Cologne to keep a careful eye
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0033 the astronauts on the International space station follow steady pre defined rhythm of work and rest to make sure get
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0035 to pace yourself of course in the beginning you're very excited you want to do everything very quickly but it doesn't work you can't maintain this rhythm for six months you have to yourself and you have to try to maintain
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0046 part of that experiment their bodies and minds studied and recorded we explore how humans adapt to in space
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0047 one of the ongoing experiments on the ISS called energy and Luca Parmitano is one of the subjects with tests
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0055 optimise food allotments for example for long term spaceflights and to better understand what the really needs on long term spaceflights
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0062 for reason one of the central of research is to understand how our body reacts to living in zero
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0067 and that is the big danger that they lose bone mass over time it's in the order of one to two percent per month so after six months you already lost a significant
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0069 the only hope to maintain muscle and bone is to do exercise cycling jogging and weightlifting
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0070 the bones of an astronaut who spends six months in space will take six months to recover
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0080 so all of small that you normally use you don't use any more in weightlessness I mean we do a lot sports even
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0086 space itself and all the highly charged particles of radiation that bombard the
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0087 of course very well aware the long term medical effects that space flight have yes you have a higher level of radiation there
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0090 about the same type of radiation or level of radiation as worker in a nuclear factory during his entire career
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0091 that kind of radiation exposure could lead to cancers such as leukemia but for the moment the medical team to find any long term effects of spaceflight
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0094 the astronauts all the data worldwide of all astronauts put into a database we try
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0095 to identify specific medical issues that be related to the occupation of an
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0096 an occupation with risks also huge rewards and the view from the window is this a
20130101_20130531_en_agge-0104 the biggest concern is to try and make it count for every second to create memories while they are up there
20130101_20130531_en_aggf-0001 European football's governing UEFA has toughened up it's stance on racism within the game and introduced a minimum ten match ban for any players or officials found guilty of racist abuse
20130101_20130531_en_aggf-0010 clubs would also face closure of stadiums for a first incident of racist abuse by fans and a full closure for a second offence the new sanctions only apply matches in European competition although is domestic leagues will adopt the same punishments soon
20130101_20130531_en_aggg-0004 well I saw a man on the road obviously injured and car crashed so I assumed was a road accident when I approached
20130101_20130531_en_aggg-0008 I thought OK' and because I was down I could see a revolver a butcher's knife
20130101_20130531_en_aggh-0005 police are still trying to establish what happened on Wednesday afternoon witnesses say two men used a car to run down the victim whom they then attacked knives and a machete shouting
20130101_20130531_en_aggh-0006 God is great around twenty minutes later an armed response unit arrived and shot the men but not one of the suspects was filmed by a
20130101_20130531_en_aggh-0008 killing sparked a terror alert with suspicions raised that this was a possible jihadist attack one of the alleged killers is reportedly twenty-eight year old Michael
20130101_20130531_en_aggh-0010 Muslim leaders in the UK have strongly condemned the attack declaring it not carried out in the name of Islam
20130101_20130531_en_aggh-0011 what seen is a ratcheting up of tensions we have seen hysteria about Muslims and Islam
20130101_20130531_en_aggh-0015 these kind of sparks can cause real real and that is the danger that communities do not turn on themselves
20130101_20130531_en_aggh-0016 but as police investigate whether the killing was part of a terrorist plot or carried out by so called lone wolves' there have already been two attacks on mosques in the of England the British National Party has issued anti immigration statements and last night members of the far right English Defence League clashed with police
20130101_20130531_en_aggi-0011 compared to similar actions of law enforcement bodies abroad in Europe Britain etc where police act with a measure of brutality to quell riots
20130101_20130531_en_aggi-0015 have expressed concerns about inaction of the police and called upon Ukrainian authorities to
20130101_20130531_en_aggi-0016 effectively and quickly investigate those cases of violence including against journalists
20130101_20130531_en_aggi-0017 of course following very closely the follow up and actions taken because it's very important that these

20130101_20130531_en_aghn-0011 the number of religious in Turkey is increasing all the time but some people are questions about the role of religion in education and the goals of some of these religious schools
20130101_20130531_en_aghn-0016 but whether Islamic schools are simply a way of preserving cultural traditions or whether they have another agenda remains a topic of debate

20130101_20130531_en_agho-0010 in Interior they've been averaging four five degrees below normal so people kept the heating going an extra tank of fuel for that cost family four hundred forty-five euros at ninety cents a litre
20130101_20130531_en_agho-0011 this has meant a five ten percent rise in electricity consumption compared to previous years similarly for combustible pellets

20130101_20130531_en_agho-0026 these are cold airstreams often disturbed often unstable so we will keep getting below normal temperatures today for example we are seeing a temperature ten degrees Celsius the average for this season and
20130101_20130531_en_agho-0032 you need to know is cold in Western Europe it is very warm in places like Russia Finland where the temperatures could get as high as twenty-five thirty degrees Celsius it's often like that in Europe when there is a really long period of cold in one part there are very warm temperatures on the opposite side of the
20130101_20130531_en_agho-0038 this the question every meteorologist dream of answering there is no link between a cold spring and a summer or the opposite atmospheric circulation means you can experience many different weather conditions in a relatively short time
20130101_20130531_en_agho-0039 you could get subtropical conditions developing mean temperatures of around twenty-five thirty degrees for France and the Benelux countries
20130101_20130531_en_agho-0040 but to get this we would need an anticyclone over the centre of Europe Bulgaria example and then we here would have rising hot air which would last three weeks

20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0006 the charter brings together a wide range of principles into one document and raising awareness about how it can be used effectively is a key challenge
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0007 it is legally binding on EU states but only when they apply European law
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0010 to the Belgian capital to talk to some of those most likely to come the charter in their work
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0013 to put that to the test caught up with some workers at a new independent legal help centre set up in January
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0014 the EU rights clinic is a joint venture between the NGO European citizen action service and Kent University in Brussels
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0016 however in my daily work in my work here at the European rights clinic I'm not going to look at the charter as my first text of reference
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0020 we can make use of some of those rights in work here at the citizens' House rights clinic we can use rights such as the freedom of movement for citizens which now a fundamental right enshrined in the document
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0021 we can use as a reference for legal services in so far as giving legal advice to people in order to them as as in our advocacy
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0022 in a new progress report on the charter the European Commission says national courts are increasingly referring to the document
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0025 says the number of cases where the EU Court of justice has quoted the text in its judgements almost doubled last year
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0026 infringement proceedings against Malta and Hungary are also given as examples of where the principles of the charter have been
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0027 the report also shows what fundamental rights issues were most raised correspondence with the European Commission
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0028 top of the list was freedom of movement and residence followed by the functioning of national justice systems and access to justice then the right to choose an occupation and work
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0030 but still it seems a lot has to be to make sure the charter is better understood and more widely used
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0031 rights organisations argue that while it a crucial document the question of exactly who is bound by it and under circumstances remains difficult to work
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0034 also ask for more preliminary rulings but at the same time it also indicates there is room improvement because what is needed is further clarification of the scope of charter we all that it refers to actions undertaken European institutions or to EU law when it's applied on
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0035 level what this exactly means is still not clear even for the courts this is also the reason why they're asking for preliminary rulings
20130101_20130531_en_agkp-0036 the charter will soon move in other directions coming into force in Croatia for example when it joins the EU in July

20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0021 European leaders and the IMF were saying for months that a country the size of Cyprus can't have a banking sector which is eight times the size of its GDP
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0022 Cyprus's economy was largely on its banking sector given the Eurogroup's decision do you think that the danger of a national default has been completely overcome
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0030 a very healthy banking system was led to the of collapse endangering us with default on our national commitments

20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0039 not to think that the European system of independent central banks opposes mutual respect
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0042 however the actions of central bank governors affect the policies of elected governments
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0043 therefore there should be mutual respect between an elected leadership and an independent appointed official
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0045 let's look at another unresolved matter of importance for Cyprus reunification recently there have been some diplomatic and political moves all sides involved from Turkey the EU and even NATO
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0047 I'd like to ask you about report from the United Nations special adviser on Cyprus Alexander Downer what exactly does it say do you accept its findings
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0049 I have to say that it is nothing but description of what was done from two thousand eight until twelve
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0051 but it is not in any way a basis on which we are going to pursue the negotiations nor we are bound by any convergence which was successfully accomplished in past
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0053 that is correct but that doesn't mean we will the points on which we agree which do give us a foundation
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0056 of course that doesn't mean there is either numerical or quantitative equality when we look at participation in the exploitation and development of sources of income
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0057 the Secretary General of NATO has said that drilling will begin only after Cyprus's division is resolved what do you say to that
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0058 nobody can define our sovereign rights and connect them to our national solution we do want a solution we want Liberation we want reunification with peaceful co existence
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0060 but you cannot achieve that through the pressure of blackmail I don't speak NATO's Anders Rasmussen
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0061 but if you to the benefits of exploiting natural gas resources you shouldn't have to agree to an unacceptable solution
20130101_20130531_en_agqh-0075 to conclude what would you the people of Cyprus we all know they are suffering and expecting hard times ahead
